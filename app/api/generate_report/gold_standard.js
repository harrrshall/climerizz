        1.12 Sustainable Development Contributions
Provide a brief description that includes the following (no more than 100 words):
    • A summary description of project activities implemented during the monitoring period that result in SD contributions (i.e., technologies/measures implemented, activity location).
    • An explanation of how project activities result in the SD contributions described in Table 1 of this report. 
    • Identification of which SD contributions described in Table 1 of this report contribute to achieving any nationally stated sustainable development priorities, including any provisions for monitoring and reporting these.
Evidence of the project’s SD contributions shall be provided as appendices to this report. 
Activities implemented during previous monitoring periods shall not be described in this report. Where no activities were implemented during the monitoring period, state as such.
Using Table 1 below, provide the project’s quantifiable contributions to specific targets and indicators of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for the monitoring period. Use the official list of SDG Targets and Indicators (available here) to identify the SDG Targets to which the project has contributed. Evidence for each contribution shall be identified in accordance with Section 1.11.  
Contributions should be aligned with the SDGs, as follows: 
    • Where possible, relate all contributions to official SDG targets and indicators. Refer to the SDG metadata repository (available here) for guidance on the definitions and concepts included in the SDG indicators (see the examples in rows 1 and 2 in the table below). 
    • While climate change and mitigation activities relate to SDG 13, they do not align with any SDG 13 target. For climate change mitigation impacts, write “13.0” in the SDG target column and use the indicator “Tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions avoided or removed” (see the example in row 3 in the table below).
    • Where a project’s self-defined measure for tracking a benefit does not align with an official SDG indicator, do not provide an indicator number. Instead, write a project-specific indicator that relates to the most appropriate SDG target (see the example in row 4 in the table below). 
Document total project contributions since the project start date, previous SD contribution monitoring period, or VCS monitoring period in the “Current Project Contributions” column and the cumulative contributions over the project lifetime in the “Contributions Over the Project Lifetime” column in Table 1 below. The cumulative impact should be calculated by summing the current project contributions with all impacts included in previously approved VCS monitoring reports or Sustainable Development Contribution Reports.
Remove rows 1-4 of Table 1 below, which serve as instruction and examples. Add or remove other rows from the table as necessary.

Where appropriate, include line diagrams to display the GHG data collection and management system.
    5 Quantification of GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
        5.1 Baseline Emissions
Quantify the baseline emissions and/or carbon stock changes for the monitoring period in accordance with the applied methodology. Baseline emissions may be negative where carbon stock increases (sinks) exceed baseline emissions. Specify the reductions and removals separately where the applied methodology provides procedures and equations to do so. Include all relevant equations here and provide sufficient information to allow the reader to reproduce the calculation. Include all calculations in the emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet.
        5.2 Project Emissions
Quantify project emissions and/or carbon stock changes for the monitoring period in accordance with the applied methodology. Project emissions may be negative where carbon stock increases (sinks) exceed project emissions. Specify the reductions and removals separately where the applied methodology provides procedures and equations to do so.  Include all relevant equations here and provide sufficient information to allow the reader to reproduce the calculation. Include all calculations in the emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet. 
        5.3 Leakage Emissions
Quantify leakage emissions for the monitoring period in accordance with the applied methodology. Specify the reductions and removals separately where the applied methodology provides procedures and equations to do so. Include all relevant equations here and provide sufficient information to allow the reader to reproduce the calculation. Include all calculations in the emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet.
        5.4 GHG Emission Reductions and Carbon Dioxide Removals
Quantify the GHG emission reductions (reductions) and carbon dioxide removals (removals) for the monitoring period. Include all relevant equations.  
Complete the tables below by vintage period (calendar year). Note that the baseline or project emissions subtotals may be negative where sinks exceed emissions. Only specify the estimated VCUs for reductions and removals separately where the applied methodology provides procedures and equations to do so.

1 Introduction

1 INTRODUCTION
The Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) Program provides a global program and standard for GHG emission
reduction and removal projects and programs. It uses as its core the requirements set out in ISO 140642, ISO 14064-3, and ISO 14065. The VCS Program Guide (this document) is the overarching program
document and provides the rules and requirements governing the VCS Program and describes the
constituent parts of the program such as the project and program registration process, the Verra Registry
system, the methodology development and review process, and the accreditation requirements for
validation/verification bodies.

1.1 Version
VCS Program editions are labeled with a version number and program documents are correspondingly
version controlled. VCS Version 4 is the fourth working version of the VCS, having been preceded by VCS
Version 1 (the initial version), VCS 2007, and VCS 2007.1 (which were two releases of the same version,
but with the latter version incorporating the agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU)
specifications), and VCS Version 3.
VCS Version 4 was released on 19 September 2019 and becomes the applicable version with immediate
effect, except where grace periods were set out for particular requirements.
VCS Version 4 is comprised of all the program documents labeled v4.x, where x is a running number
starting at zero. Individual program documents may be updated from time to time, as developments
require, and their version numbers will be incremented using the v4.x format. Such updated documents
still form part of Version 4 and the VCS Program edition should be referred to as VCS Version 4 regardless
of the version numbers of the individual program documents. Where documents are updated, an
appendix to the document will clearly state the updates made and their effective date. VCS Program
stakeholders will be informed of the updates, and the updates will also be cataloged on the Verra
website. Readers shall ensure that they are using the most current version of this and all other program
documents.
Note that correction documents may also be issued periodically to correct errors in text, equations, or
figures in VCS Program documents or methodologies. In addition, clarification documents may be issued
to provide additional guidance or clarity on the VCS Program rules, or to issue minor, urgent updates to
requirements in between new versions of VCS Program documents. Correction and clarification
documents are posted to the Verra website alongside the relevant program document or methodology
and are effective on their issuance date. Project proponents and validation/verification bodies must apply
and interpret the VCS Program rules and methodological requirements consistent with any corrections
and clarifications. Corrections and clarifications will be incorporated into the next issued version of the
relevant program document or methodology, at which time the corrections and clarifications will be
moved to an archive page on the Verra website.

1

1 Introduction
New versions of the VCS Program will be issued periodically when major edition updates are required.
Development of new versions of the program will include public consultation and will be announced on
the Verra website and to VCS Program stakeholders.
The VCS Program documents for previous versions of the VCS Program are available on the Verra website,
and these should be referred to for the rules and requirements under such previous versions of the VCS
Program.
Note that projects, programs, and verified carbon units (VCUs) are not labeled in the Verra Registry with a
specific version of the VCS Program (i.e., projects are not “Version 3 projects” or “Version 4 projects”, and
likewise with VCUs). The VCS Program documentation is merely labeled with a version in order to provide
version control over the program documents.
Where external documents are referenced, such as ISO 14064-2, ISO 14064-3, and ISO 14064, and
such documents are updated, the most recent version of the document shall be used.

1.2 Language
The operating language of the VCS Program is English. The VCS Program documents may be translated
into other languages to facilitate local use. However, the English versions of VCS Program documents,
and the interpretation of same, shall take precedence over any other language translations.

1.3 Definitions
Definitions as set out in the VCS Program Definitions, ISO 14064-2, ISO 14064-3, and ISO 14065 shall
apply to all VCS Program documentation. Note that defined terms in the VCS Program documents, in
common with ISO convention, are used without capital first letters.

2 Overview of the VCS Program

2 OVERVIEW OF THE VCS PROGRAM
2.1 Program Objectives
The VCS Program establishes the rules and requirements that operationalize the VCS Standard to enable
the validation of GHG projects and programs and the verification of GHG emission reductions and
removals that can be used both in voluntary and compliance markets. The VCS Program aims to:
1) Establish clear rules and procedures to enable the successful development of GHG projects and
programs and the creation of high-quality GHG credits;
2) Create a trusted and fungible GHG credit, the VCU;
3) Stimulate innovation in GHG mitigation technologies and measures as well as procedures for
validation, verification, and registration, all within a context of quality, credibility, and
transparency;
4) Provide a secure registry system for all VCUs that offers assurance against double counting and
provides transparency to the public;
5) Demonstrate workable frameworks and offer lessons that can be incorporated into other GHG
programs and climate change regulation;
6) Provide oversight to ensure that investors, buyers and the market recognizes VCUs as being real,
additional, and permanent; and
7) Link carbon markets worldwide through a coherent and robust framework.

2.2 Program History
The Climate Group, the International Emissions Trading Association, and the World Business Council for
Sustainable Development are the partner organizations that founded the VCS Program. The World
Economic Forum also partnered in the development of the VCS Program for part of the process. VCS
Version 1 was released on 28 March 2006 as both a consultation document and a standard for use by
the market. VCS Version 2 was released in October 2006 as a consultation document and did not replace
VCS Version 1 as the applicable version. After two years of work, two rounds of public consultation, and
the work of the 19-member steering committee1 and seven technical working groups, VCS 2007 was
released on 19 November 2007. VCS 2007.1, which incorporated requirements for agriculture, forestry,
and other land use projects, was released on 18 November 2008. VCS Version 3 was issued on 8 March
2011. VCS Version 4 was released on 19 September 2019.

1 The members of the steering committee were Jan-Willem Bode, Derik Broekhoff, Mike Burnett, Robert Dornau, Steve

Drummond, Mitchell Feierstein, Yoshito Izumi, Mark Kenber, Adam Kirkman, Andrei Marcu, Erin Meezan, Ken Newcombe, Mark
Proegler, Robert Routliffe, Richard Samans, Marc Stuart, Einar Telnes, Bill Townsend and Diane Wittenberg.

2 Overview of the VCS Program

2.3 Program Scope
The VCS Program provides the standard and framework for independent validation of projects and
programs, and verification of GHG emission reductions and removals, based on ISO 14064-2 and ISO
14064-3. The scope of the VCS Program covers all those activities related to the generation of GHG
emission reductions and removals, including jurisdictional programs and nested REDD+ projects. The
scope does not include carbon footprint assessments or carbon neutrality claims.
Participation is voluntary and based on objective criteria. The VCS Program is not discriminatory to project
proponents, jurisdictional proponents, methodology developers, validation/verification bodies, or VCU
buyers, sellers, or brokers.

2.4 Program Documents
The rules and requirements for the VCS Program are set out in the program documents. Projects,
programs, and methodologies shall meet all the applicable rules and requirements set out in these
documents.
The structure of the program documents is summarized in Diagram 1. The VCS Program Guide is the
overarching program document, providing the rules and requirements governing the VCS Program and
further describing the constituent parts of the program such as the project and program registration
process, the Verra Registry system, the methodology development and review process, and the
accreditation requirements for validation/verification bodies. Complementing the VCS Program Guide are
requirements documents, procedural documents, and templates and forms. Verra may issue new
documents, as developments in the VCS Program require, and the complete and current list of the
program documents is available on the Verra website.

bodies for use in accreditation or other forms of recognition.
4) The GHG Protocol for Project Accounting (Chapter 7, guidance related to additionality and
6

2 Overview of the VCS Program
common practice), WRI, 2005.
The four standards above are part of the requirements of the VCS Program, and their requirements shall
be met either by the project proponent (ISO 14064-2) or the validation/verification body (ISO 14064-3
and ISO 14065). Where there is any conflict between VCS Program documentation and the above
normative references, the VCS Program documentation shall take precedence.
The program documents are also complemented by guidance documents. These guidance documents do
not set out VCS Program rules and requirements, but they provide additional information to assist with
the interpretation of the rules and requirements. It is strongly encouraged that such guidance is followed.

2.5 Roles and Responsibilities
2.5.1

Project and Jurisdictional Proponents

Project and jurisdictional proponents are the entities with overall control and responsibility for projects or
programs. A project may have one project or jurisdictional proponent, or there may be multiple project or
jurisdictional proponents who collectively have overall control and responsibility for a project or program.
Project and jurisdictional proponents establish and operate projects and programs in accordance with the
VCS Program rules. They are responsible for providing the project or program description, monitoring
report, and supporting documentation (including evidence of project ownership or program ownership) to
facilitate validation and verification.
Project and jurisdictional proponents sign unilateral representations with respect to their projects or
programs and VCUs, and these are made available on the Verra Registry. Project proponents assume
limited liability for the replacement of excess VCUs, as set out in Section 4.2.
Note – To aid the readability of the VCS Program documentation, the documents use project and
jurisdictional proponent in the singular. For projects and programs with multiple project or jurisdictional
proponents, “project proponents” or “jurisdictional proponents” should be substituted in place of “project
proponent” or “jurisdictional proponent”, as appropriate.

2.5.2

Methodology Developers

Methodology developers are entities that develop new or revised methodologies, modules, and tools that
are subject to the methodology development and review process.

2.5.3

Validation/Verification Bodies

Validation/verification bodies are accredited to:
1) Validate projects and verify GHG emission reductions and removals.
2) Assess methodologies under the methodology development and review process.

Validation/verification bodies are only eligible to carry out work for the sectoral scopes for validation and
verification for which they hold accreditation and must sign the required agreement with Verra before they

7

2 Overview of the VCS Program
can perform validation or verification in connection with the VCS Program. The list of
validation/verification bodies is available on the Verra website.

2.5.4

Verra Registry

The Verra Registry is responsible for ensuring that all required project and program documents have been
submitted to Verra; issuing and maintaining accounts of VCUs for accountholders; ensuring the seamless
flow of VCUs throughout the entire Verra Registry system; tracking and reporting the deposit/withdrawal
of buffer credits to/from the centrally managed AFOLU pooled buffer account and jurisdictional pooled
buffer account; and maintaining custody and records of VCU legal ownership.

2.5.5

VCU Buyers, Sellers, and Brokers

Buyers, sellers, and brokers are companies, organizations, or individuals who transact VCUs or facilitate
the transaction of VCUs.

2.5.6

Verra

The VCS Program is managed by Verra, which is an independent, non-profit organization incorporated
under the laws of the District of Columbia in the United States. Verra is responsible for managing,
overseeing, and developing the program. It maintains an impartial position in the market and does not
develop projects, programs, or methodologies, nor does it provide validation, verification, or consulting
services.
One of Verra’s roles is in respect of overseeing and ensuring the integrity of projects, programs, and VCUs
in the Verra Registry system. Verra conducts reviews of project and program registration and verification
requests. Verra is also responsible for overseeing the validation/verification bodies operating under the
VCS Program.
Verra’s review of projects is conducted in accordance with the Registration and Issuance Process. The
review ensures that the validation/verification body has appropriately assessed, and fully described how
it has assessed, the project’s conformance with the VCS Program rules. Reviews do not replace validation
or verification.
Verra also conducts other types of validation/verification body reviews. These include, but are not limited
to, desk reviews of the validation/verification body work, visits to the validation/verification body offices,
witnessing the validation/verification body undertaking audits (in person and remotely), and reviewing
work products developed by the validation/verification body in performing the audits.
Where Verra identifies shortcomings in a validation/verification body’s performance, Verra provides
feedback and requires the validation/verification body to address non-conformities. Verra also reports
validation/verification body performance to the respective accreditation body.
Verra reserves the right to take action against validation/verification bodies and implement sanctions in
accordance with the provisions set out in the agreements signed with Verra (See Section 6). The rights
and obligations for validation/verification bodies are set out in such agreements.

8

2 Overview of the VCS Program
Verra reserves the right not to list projects, register projects and programs, or issue VCUs where it deems
that they do not conform with the VCS Program rules or may otherwise impact the integrity of the VCS
Program or the functioning of the broader carbon market. Verra reserves the right to cancel VCUs or to
reject, put on hold, or inactivate projects where it deems that they have not been registered or issued in
conformance with the VCS Program rules. At listing, Verra may deny the request and/or reject the project
where the listing request is frivolous, vexatious, or an abuse of process. Verra makes the reasons for such
decisions publicly available on the project page on the registry.
Verra is also responsible for managing the methodology development and review process, and it reserves
the right to not accept methodologies into the process, put on hold or reject methodologies in the
development and review process, or review, revise or set as inactive previously approved methodologies
where it deems that they do not conform with the VCS Program rules, would sanction politically or
ethically contentious project activities, or may otherwise impact the integrity of the VCS Program or the
functioning of the broader carbon market.
Verra may convene steering committees, advisory committees, or working groups to support its work in
specific areas. These groups draw in expertise from outside the organization to develop and support
specific elements of the VCS Program. A full list of steering committees and working groups is available
on the Verra website.

3 VCS Program Criteria for GHG Projects and Programs

3 VCS PROGRAM CRITERIA FOR GHG
PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS
All projects and programs shall meet the requirements set out in the VCS Version 4 program documents.
GHG emission reductions and removals verified under the VCS Program and issued as VCUs shall meet
the following principles:
Real
All GHG emission reductions and removals and the projects or programs that generate them must be
proven to have genuinely taken place.
Measurable
All GHG emission reductions and removals must be quantifiable using recognized measurement tools
(including adjustments for uncertainty and leakage) against a credible emissions baseline.
Permanent
Where GHG emission reductions or removals are generated by projects or programs that carry a risk of
reversibility, adequate safeguards must be in place to ensure that the risk of reversal is minimized and
that, should any reversal occur, a mechanism is in place that guarantees the reductions or removals will
be replaced or compensated.
Additional
GHG emission reductions and removals must be additional to what would have happened under a
business-as-usual scenario if the project had not been carried out.
Independently Audited
All GHG emission reductions and removals must be verified to a reasonable level of assurance by an
accredited validation/verification body with the expertise necessary in both the country and sector in
which the project is taking place.
Unique
Each VCU must be unique and must only be associated with a single GHG emission reduction or removal
activity. There must be no double counting, or double claiming of the environmental benefit, in respect of
the GHG emission reductions or removals.
Transparent
There must be sufficient and appropriate public disclosure of GHG-related information to allow intended
users to make decisions with reasonable confidence.
Conservative
Conservative assumptions, values, and procedures must be used to ensure that the GHG emission
reductions or removals are not over-estimated.

10

4 Verra Registry

4 VERRA REGISTRY
The Verra Registry provides the public interface to all project, program, and VCU information. VCU serial
numbers are generated by the registry, which ensures the uniqueness of projects, programs, and VCUs. In
addition, the Verra Registry provides full transparency on project and program documentation, together
with information on the project and jurisdictional proponents, VCU issuance and retirement, the AFOLU
pooled buffer account, and the jurisdictional pooled buffer account.
The AFOLU pooled buffer account holds non-tradable buffer credits to cover the non-permanence risk
associated with AFOLU projects. It is a single account that holds the buffer credits for all projects. The
account is subject to a periodic reconciliation, as set out in the VCS Standard. Likewise, the jurisdictional
pooled buffer account holds the non-tradable buffer credits to cover the non-permanence risk associated
with jurisdictional REDD+ programs and nested projects.
The Verra Registry provides accountholder services and is the entry point into the registry system for
project and jurisdictional proponents, and VCU buyers and sellers. Such market participants open an
account with the Verra Registry and project and program registration and VCU issuance is initiated with
the Verra Registry.
The Verra Registry is responsible for: ensuring that projects and programs are registered and VCUs are
issued in accordance with the VCS Program rules; providing services for holding, transferring, and retiring
VCUs; managing AFOLU and jurisdictional buffer credits; and providing custodial services for VCUs and
maintaining records of VCU legal ownership.
Project and jurisdictional proponents (or other eligible entities, as set out in the Registration and
Issuance Process and JNR Registration and Issuance Process) request listing and registration of projects
and programs and VCU issuance, with the Verra Registry. Diagram 2 outlines the project life cycle and
registration process, which is similar to the program life cycle and registration process. Once the project
or program has been validated and the GHG emission reductions or removals verified, the project or
jurisdictional proponent submits the relevant documents to the Verra Registry. Verra conducts a
completeness review of the documents and may conduct a further accuracy review to assess
conformance with the VCS Program rules. Where it is determined that the project or program complies
with the VCS Program rules, Verra uploads the documents to the public Verra Registry and issues VCUs
into the project or jurisdictional proponent’s account. Note that validation and verification may be
undertaken simultaneously, with registration and issuance of the VCUs occurring at the same time, or
validation may occur before verification, with registration occurring before any subsequent issuance of
VCUs.

The process and detailed rules and requirements for project pipeline listing, program listing, project, and
program registration, and VCU issuance are set out in the Registration and Issuance Process and JNR
Registration and Issuance Process.

4.1 VCS Program Fees
Verra charges fees to cover administration costs, at the rates set out in the VCS Program Fee Schedule.

4.2 VCU Liability And Statute Of Limitations
Registered projects and issued VCUs are subject to review by Verra, as set out in the Registration and
Issuance Process. Project proponents are responsible for compensating for excess VCU issuance where
Verra deems, acting reasonably, that there has been a material erroneous issuance of VCUs in respect of
a project, as a result of the fraudulent conduct, negligence, intentional act, recklessness,
misrepresentation, or mistake of the project proponent. A statute of limitations applies, whereby Verra
can only require such compensation in relation to any verification completed after 8 April 2014 and up to
the later of:
1) 6 years after the date of issuance of the relevant VCU; or
2) 12 months after the date upon which any second verification report with respect to the relevant
VCU is accepted on the Verra Registry.2

2 The relevant VCU will be issued following acceptance of a verification report for a project. For some types of AFOLU projects in

particular, verification cycles may be longer than 6 years. In this regard, if the second verification report shows a VCU has been
erroneously issued, Verra will have an additional 12 months to deal with that issue. Note also that where a VCU is erroneously
issued from the last verification report of a project, Section 4.2(1) applies.

5 VCS Program Approval

5 VCS PROGRAM APPROVAL
Validation/verification bodies are eligible to provide validation and verification services under the VCS
Program if they have signed the required agreement with Verra and are:
1) Accredited by an accreditation body that is a member of the International Accreditation Forum
(IAF) and granted recognition for IAF Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MLA) under ISO
17029 and/or 14065; or
2) Accredited under a VCS-approved GHG program3; and
3) Approved by Verra and listed as an active validation/verification body on Verra’s website.
The validation/verification body for a project shall hold such accreditation and Verra approval for
validation or verification (as applicable) for the sectoral scope(s) applicable to the methodology applied to
the project. Where the methodology falls under more than one sectoral scope, the validation/verification
body shall hold accreditation or approval for validation or verification (as applicable) for all relevant
sectoral scopes.
Where the validation/verification body holds such accreditation and Verra approval for the verification of
the relevant sectoral scope(s) but does not hold accreditation or approval for validation, it may validate
project description deviations and inclusion of new project activity instances in grouped projects at the
time of verification, under the following circumstances:
1) It holds accreditation and Verra approval for validation in at least one other sectoral scope;
2) It has completed validation of at least five projects under the VCS Program or an approved GHG
program, and such projects have been registered under the relevant program; and
3) The validation activity does not entail the validation of a project description deviation that
impacts the applicability of the methodology, additionality, or the appropriateness of the
baseline scenario (see the VCS Standard for further information on such deviations).
Validation/verification bodies are also eligible to conduct assessments (validation) of methodologies
under the methodology development and review process. The validation/verification body shall hold
accreditation for validation for the sectoral scope(s) applicable to the methodology. Where the
methodology falls under more than one sectoral scope, the validation/verification body shall hold
accreditation for validation for all relevant sectoral scopes. Validation/verification bodies shall ensure the
assessment team includes experts with subject-matter expertise in all areas relevant to the proposed
project activity. Validation/verification bodies may contract external experts where needed to meet this
requirement.
To apply to become an approved validation/verification body with the VCS Program, organizations must
complete a Verra Validation/Verification Body Application Form and submit the signed application, along

3 Note that acceptance of accreditation under a VCS-approved GHG program is being phased out; see Verra website for further

details.

5 VCS Program Approval
with any supporting evidence (as required by the application) to auditing@verra.org.
A list of accredited validation/verification bodies that are Verra-approved to undertake validation and
verification services under the VCS Program is available on the Verra website.

15

5 VCS Program Approval

6 VALIDATION/VERIFICATION BODY
SANCTIONS
Based on its oversight activities, Verra has sole discretion to apply sanctions that vary according to the
severity of issues and/or non-conformance(s) where validation/verification bodies are:
1) Found by Verra to be conducting services out of conformance with the governing accreditation
body and/or VCS Program rules, or
2) Deemed by Verra to be performing poorly.
Warning Issuance
Where Verra deems sanctions are merited, it may issue a warning notice and non-conformity report to the
validation/verification body, requiring it to undertake a root cause analysis and identify corrective actions
for addressing the identified issues. The root cause analysis and corrective action plan must be submitted
to Verra within the time frame identified in the warning and non-conformity report.
Verra reviews and assesses whether the validation/verification body’s root cause analysis and corrective
action plan are satisfactory or if additional sanctions may be applied.
Accreditation Body Referral
Verra may share the results of its validation/verification body non-conformity reports with relevant
accreditation bodies.
Suspension and Reinstatement
Verra may issue a notice of validation/verification body suspension at any time. Where a suspension
notice is issued, Verra provides the validation/verification body with a copy or detailed description of the
evidence upon which its decision was based. Suspension may be for the entire VCS Program, or the
validation/verification body may be suspended for specific VCS sectoral scopes per the provisions set out
in the Verra VVB Agreement.
The suspension is announced on the VCS website.
1) Where the full VCS program scope is suspended, the validation/verification body’s approved
status is changed to inactive
2) Where specific scopes are suspended, the validation/verification body status remains active, but
the suspended scope is changed from active to suspended.
A validation/verification body is automatically suspended where it is suspended by the VCS-approved
GHG program or accreditation body under which it holds accreditation.
Inactive validation/verification bodies or active validation/verification bodies with specific suspended
scopes are not permitted to conduct validation or verification audits or issue any documentation (e.g.,
validation/verification reports) concerning the suspended (inactive) program or specific scope(s) without

16

5 VCS Program Approval
Verra’s prior and explicit approval.
A sectoral scope may be reactivated and/or VCS Program approval status reinstated where:
1) The validation/verification body demonstrates to Verra’s reasonable satisfaction that:
a) The evidence upon which such suspension was based was inaccurate or misleading, or
b) The facts or circumstances leading to such suspension are no longer current or likely to affect
the validation/verification body’s performance, or
c) Its suspension by a VCS-approved GHG program or accreditation body under which it holds
accreditation is lifted, and
2) The validation/verification body has paid all validation/verification body program and
reinstatement assessment fees.

17

7 Methodology Development and Review Process

7 METHODOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AND
REVIEW PROCESS
The Methodology Development and Review Process outlines how methodologies, modules, and tools
(collectively referred to as “methodologies”) are developed and reviewed under the VCS Program.

7.1 Development of New or Revised Methodologies
The steps for the development of new methodologies and major revisions include a methodology idea
note, a concept note, a draft methodology and draft project description, a public comment period,
updates to address comments, an assessment by a verification/validation body, and a final review and
decision by Verra. Verra may also require a technical working group or external expert assessment. Minor
revisions have a simplified process. A methodology may be rejected or put on hold at any stage if it does
not meet VCS Program rules and priorities.

7.2 Periodic Review of Approved VCS Methodologies
Verra periodically reviews methodologies approved under the VCS Program to ensure they continue to
reflect best practices, scientific consensus, and evolving market conditions and technical developments
in a sector. Verra conducts a review of each methodology every five years starting after the last update or
review of the methodology, or when otherwise triggered. This includes ensuring that VCS methodologies
are consistent with the latest VCS Program rules. As a result of a review, a methodology may require
revisions to align with VCS Program rules and priorities. In place of a review, Verra may make a
methodology inactive where no projects using the methodology have been registered within five years of
the last update or review. Inactive methodologies can be reactivated by completing a review and any
associated revisions. Inactive methodologies are not valid to be applied by new projects.

7.3 Compensation for Methodology Developers
Methodology developers are eligible to receive compensation until 31 December 2025 for methodologies
that are approved under the VCS Program or that have moved from the concept note stage to the
methodology drafting stage prior to 31 December 2022.
Compensation will be paid according to the number of VCUs issued using the methodology, at the rate
and in accordance with the payment terms set out in the VCS Program Fee Schedule. Compensation is
payable with respect to VCUs issued between 15 June 2010 and 31 December 2025. Compensation is
payable for up to 60 million VCUs issued after 1 January 2023 or until 31 December 2025, whichever
comes first. Methodology developers may elect not to receive compensation by notifying Verra at any
time.
Where Verra approves the consolidation or revision of methodologies, the compensation due to the

18

7 Methodology Development and Review Process
developer of the consolidated or revised methodology and the underlying methodologies respectively will
be determined on a case-by-case basis by Verra.
Where an eligible methodology is withdrawn or put on hold, compensation remains payable until 31
December 2025 in respect of continuing issuance of VCUs to registered projects that have applied the
methodology.
Only methodologies developed under the VCS Program are eligible for the compensation mechanism.
Developers of methodology revisions, modules, and tools are not compensated under the mechanism.
Note – Project proponents pay the same VCU issuance levy regardless of the methodology applied to the
project. Verra pays any compensation to the methodology developer out of the VCU issuance levy payments
made to Verra.

8 Linking to Other GHG Programs

8 LINKING TO OTHER GHG PROGRAMS
To recognize work that has gone into developing other credible GHG programs, the VCS Program has a
process for approving GHG programs that meet VCS Program criteria. A GHG program shall demonstrate
alignment with VCS Program principles and requirements through a gap analysis and the Verra Board will
make the final decision on whether to approve the GHG program. Approval of a GHG program under the
VCS Program has three implications:
1) GHG credits under the approved GHG program may be canceled and issued as VCUs (converted
into VCUs).
2) Validation/verification bodies under the approved GHG program are approved for validation and
verification under the VCS Program (for the corresponding sectoral scopes for validation and
verification, respectively, provided they have signed the required agreement with Verra).
3) Most methodologies under the approved GHG program may be used for developing projects
under the VCS Program. See the Verra website for exclusions.
The latest version of the approved GHG program methodology shall be used and relevant grace
periods apply.
The list of approved GHG programs is available on the Verra website, together with any specific conditions
or further clarifications with respect to the scope of approval.

8.1 Gap Analysis Methodology and Process
The approval of other GHG programs is based on the principle of full compatibility with the VCS Program.
A gap analysis process is applied on a case-by-case basis to determine the other GHG program’s
conformance with VCS Program principles and requirements and to assess whether the GHG emission
reductions or removals issued under the GHG Program are fully compatible with VCUs issued under the
VCS Program.
Any party may initiate a gap analysis of another GHG program with the VCS Program. All relevant
documentation in relation to the GHG program shall be provided to Verra, with appropriate authorization
secured.
The onus is on the GHG program to demonstrate that it meets the VCS Program criteria. The costs of the
assessment are borne by the GHG program or whoever initiates the gap analysis.
Based on the gap analysis report, the Verra Board will decide whether to approve the full GHG program or
elements of the program.

8.2 Review of VCS Program-Approved GHG Programs
Approved GHG programs are reviewed periodically by Verra. Any changes made by an approved GHG
program which may affect its compatibility with the VCS Program shall be communicated immediately to
20

8 Linking to Other GHG Programs
Verra. In the event that it is considered that the changes lead to non-conformity with the VCS Program,
the Verra Board may decide to suspend or terminate its recognition of the approved GHG program. Any
projects approved under the GHG program prior to such Verra Board decision will not be affected by the
suspension or termination.

21

9 Complaints and Appeals Procedure

9 COMPLAINTS AND APPEALS
PROCEDURE
Project proponents, validation/verification bodies, methodology developers, and other stakeholders
(including interested stakeholders) may submit inquiries to Verra at any time. In addition, the VCS
Program provides a complaints and appeals procedure as set out in the Verra Complaints and Appeals
Policy available on the Verra website.

the baseline is not allocated from jurisdictional level data), APD (where the
agent is unknown), Avoiding Unplanned Conversion (AUC), and Avoiding
1

Unplanned Wetland Degradation (AUWD) project types, the project proponent
shall, for the duration of the project, reassess the baseline every six years.
For Avoiding Unplanned Deforestation projects where the baseline is
allocated from jurisdictional level data, the initial project baseline validity
period may be as little as one year but no more than seven years. The
second and subsequent project baseline validity periods shall be no more
than six years. The project proponent shall reassess the baseline at the end
of each baseline validity period.

Background:
In the new REDD methodology (VM0048 Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest
Degradation and VMD0055 Estimation of Emission Reductions from Avoiding Unplanned
Deforestation), baseline validity periods (BVPs) for Avoiding Unplanned Deforestation
activities are set at the jurisdictional level, not at the project level. While jurisdictional activity
data baselines are always valid for six years, projects that validate or transition to VM0048
after the jurisdictional BVP start date will have to update their initial project baseline more or
less frequently than every six years,
A project that validates or transitions to this methodology after the initial year of a
jurisdictional BVP may choose to use that jurisdictional baseline until the end of the
jurisdictional BVP. If the project starts in the last year of the six-year jurisdictional BVP, its
initial baseline validity period will last as little as one year.
Alternately, a project that validates or transitions to this new methodology in the second year
of a jurisdictional BVP may use this jurisdictional baseline for up to seven years. This would
be the case if it exercises the option outlined in VMD0055 to use its original baseline through
the second year of the subsequent jurisdictional BVP.
Subsequent project baseline must be the same duration as the jurisdictional BVP.

a) Methodologies shall…. Such analysis shall be based on historical factors over at
least the previous 10 years that explain past patterns and can be used to
make future projections of deforestation. Where methodologies use a
jurisdictional allocation approach, the methodology may allow a time gap
between the (jurisdictional) historical reference period and the start of a
project’s baseline validity period.

Background:
Jurisdictional allocation approaches, e.g., VM0048, use a jurisdictional historical reference
period to determine a baseline scenario for the entire jurisdiction. This jurisdictional baseline
scenario is valid for a set duration called (a “jurisdictional baseline validity period”). The
proposed update to the methodology requirement allows a gap between the jurisdictional
historical reference period and the start of the project baseline validity period (BVP) to
accommodate several scenarios under VM0048.
Where a project validates or transitions to VM0048 after the start of the jurisdictional BVP,
the end of the historical reference period will not align with the start of the project’s BVP.
Where a project proponent chooses to extend a project’s baseline for up to two years into the
jurisdictional BVP after the project begins to use VM0048 (see Clarification 1/VCS Standard,
v4.5 Section 3.2.5), the end of the jurisdictional historical reference period will not align with
the second project BVP under VM0048.
In the third project baseline under VM0048, projects must align with the jurisdictional BVP.
Therefore, their historical reference periods will immediately precede the start of the BVP.

1 Introduction

1 INTRODUCTION
This document outlines the procedures for listing pipeline projects, registering projects, and issuing
verified carbon units (VCUs) under the VCS Program. This document is intended for use by project
proponents, validation/verification bodies, VCU buyers, VCU sellers and any other entities participating
in the VCU market. Note that the VCS Standard and its related documents provide the rules and
requirements for developing projects, and this document (the Registration and Issuance Process)
should not be used for such purpose.
Projects may have one or many project proponents, though to aid readability, this document uses
project proponent in the singular. For projects with multiple project proponents, project proponents
should be substituted in place of project proponent, as appropriate.
Project proponents interact with the Verra Registry to list pipeline projects, register projects, and issue
VCUs (i.e., project pipeline listing, project registration and VCU issuance are handled by the Verra
Registry). Verra staff are responsible for undertaking a completeness check on documentation and for
ensuring adherence to the VCS Program rules with respect to the pipeline listing process and the
project registration process. Verra staff also upload information to the Verra Registry.
The Verra Registry provides the central repository for all information and documentation relating to
pipeline and registered projects. The registry is also responsible for ensuring uniqueness of projects,
issuing VCU serial numbers, and tracking VCU retirement. The registry makes project and VCU
information and documentation publicly available and can be accessed via the Verra website. As set
out in the VCS Program Guide, Verra is responsible for reviewing project documentation and overseeing
validation/verification bodies to ensure the integrity of projects and VCUs in the Verra Registry.
Project documents must be submitted in electronic format.
The operating language of the VCS Program is English. The project and program description, validation
report, monitoring report, verification report and all other documentation (including all and any
appendices) required under the VCS Program must be in English.
This document will be updated from time-to-time, and readers shall ensure that they are using the most
current version of the document.

2 Opening a Verra Registry Account

2 OPENING A VERRA REGISTRY
ACCOUNT
A Verra Registry account shall be opened by any market participant who wants to list a pipeline project,
register a project and/or issue, trade or retire VCUs as set out in Diagram 1.
Diagram 1: Opening a Verra Registry Account

2.1.1

The Verra Registry is managed and operated by Verra staff. Further details about the Verra
Registry are available in the VCS Program Guide.

2.1.2

A market participant can apply to open a Verra Registry account at any time. For example, a
would-be project proponent does not need to have a validated or verified project and a wouldbe VCU buyer does not need to have entered into a legal agreement to purchase VCUs in order
to open a Verra Registry account.

2.1.3

Market participants can apply to open a Verra Registry account through the Verra website.
Market participants are also encouraged to contact the Verra Registry at any time at
registry@verra.org.

3 Pipeline Listing Process

3

PIPELINE LISTING PROCESS

The Verra Registry includes a project pipeline which lists projects before they are registered. Projects
may list on the pipeline in the early stages of development as under development or as under
validation when they are ready to begin the public consultation and validation process.
Note that where a methodology element is put on hold or withdrawn, only projects that have been listed
on the project pipeline as either under development or under validation by the date on which the
methodology element is put on hold or withdrawn shall be granted the grace period for using the
methodology element (i.e., any projects not listed on the project pipeline by such date shall not be
granted the grace period). Project proponents may therefore wish to list their projects at the early
stages of project development to ensure that they can take advantage of any grace periods. See the
VCS Standard for more information on grace periods.
Diagram 2 below sets out the process for listing and the public comment period where a project initially
requests to list on the pipeline as under development. Diagram 3 below, sets out the process for listing
on the pipeline and the public comment period where a project initially requests to list on the pipeline
as under validation. Notes that follow the diagrams provide further details.

3.1

Process

3.1.1

The only entities that may initiate the pipeline listing process are the project proponent, an
entity to which the project proponent has assigned sole right to the GHG emission reductions
(reductions) and carbon dioxide removals (removals) for the entire project crediting period, an
entity who has been authorized by the project proponent(s) to list the project on the project
pipeline or the authorized representative of any of these entities.

3.1.2

To initiate the pipeline listing process, such entities shall submit the required documents for
listing to the Verra Registry and change the status of the project to pipeline listing requested.
Pipeline projects shall be listed as either under development or under validation. Projects
under development are those which have not yet contracted a validation/verification body to
perform validation. Projects under validation are those that have contracted a
validation/verification body to perform validation and are ready to begin the validation process.

3.1.3

To list a project as under development, such entities shall submit the following to the Verra
Registry:
A draft project description which shall include (at a minimum) the cover page and drafts of
Sections 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12, 1.14, 1.15, 1.16, 1.17,

Registration and Issuance Process, v4.5

3 Pipeline Listing Process
1.18, 3.1 and 3.2, of the VCS Project Description Template1, or the equivalent Sections in
the VCS Joint Project Description & Monitoring Report Template.
Note - Indicative information is sufficient (e.g., the proposed approach for establishing project
ownership, rather than the full rationale and evidence that will be submitted for validation).
A listing representation.
3.1.4

To list a project as under validation, the following shall be submitted to Verra:
1) A project description with all sections of the VCS Project Description Template or the VCS
Joint Project Description & Monitoring Report Template completed.
2) Proof of contracting of the validation, provided in accordance with Section 4.2.11.
A listing representation.

3.1.5

The project proponent shall pay the pipeline listing fee before Verra will process the listing
request submission. Where the project listed as under development first, the fee will not be
required when the project subsequently requests to list the project as under validation.
Note – Pipeline projects may either apply an approved methodology or a methodology that is
under development. Where a methodology under development is applied, the project
description shall provide a reference for the draft version of the methodology.

3.1.6

Projects participating in multiple Verra programs (e.g. the VCS Program and the CCB Program)
may submit joint templates only if the project proponent is making concurrent requests under
the VCS Program and the other program(s).

3.1.7

The following applies with respect to the listing representation:
1) The Verra website provides the template for the listing representation. The template shall
not be altered other than to fill in the project-specific details.
2) The listing representation shall be properly executed as a deed in accordance with
applicable local laws and the organization’s own constitutional documents (e.g., signature
by directors and requirement of company seals).
3) Where more than one individual or organization can claim rights in respect of the execution
of the listing representation, and there exists no other (single) entity which may execute the
listing representation, all such individuals and organizations shall execute the listing
representation, using the appropriate template available on the Verra website for pipeline
projects with multiple project proponents, as applicable. Note that such representations
may be executed in any necessary number of counterparts.

3.1.8

All project documents shall be submitted to the Verra Registry in electronic format.

1 Section numbers are based on the VCS Project Description Template, v4.4

Registration and Issuance Process, v4.5

3 Pipeline Listing Process
3.1.9

Where a project proponent requests to list a project as under development, Verra conducts a
completeness review of the submitted project documents to ensure that:
1) The relevant sections of the VCS Project Description Template have been completed in
accordance with Sections 3.1.1.
2) The listing representation has been signed by the relevant responsible parties.
Any issues raised as a result of the Verra completeness review shall be addressed before the
project listing request can proceed.

3.1.10 Where a project is requesting to list as, or update its status to under validation, Verra reviews
the submitted project documents to ensure that sufficient information is present for the project
to undergo public comment. Any issues raised as a result of the Verra review shall be
addressed before the project can proceed to public comment.
3.1.11 The project proponent uploads all relevant documents to the Verra Registry. The project
proponent shall use all the information from the project documents to create the project record
in the Verra Registry. The status of the project is set to under development or under validation,
as appropriate. All documents submitted are posted publicly, except for commercially sensitive
information and proof of contracting.
3.1.12 For projects listed initially as under development, the project status shall be updated to under
validation by submitting the required documentation set out in Section 3.1.4 (noting that a
second listing representation is not required) in order to undergo public comment, as set out in
Sections 3.1.13 –3.1.14, below. Verra undertakes the relevant checks set out in Section 3.1.9.
3.1.13 Projects shall undergo a 30-day public comment period. The public comment period starts on
the date on which the project status is updated to under validation or the date on which the
project is listed on the pipeline as under validation.
3.1.14 Any comments shall be submitted through the project’s page on the Verra Registry.
Respondents shall provide their name, organization, country, and email address. At the end of
the public comment period, Verra provides all comments received to the project proponent.
Verra posts a public summary of all comments received during the public comment period. The
project proponent shall address such comments as set out in the VCS Standard.
3.1.15 Verra stores the electronic and signed original project documents in its record-keeping system
for a minimum period of 12 years from the date the project is listed on the project pipeline.
3.1.16 Where a pipeline project successfully completes validation, it may progress to project
registration on the Verra Registry, following the procedures set out in Section 4.
3.1.17 Where a pipeline project does not successfully complete validation within the timeframes
specified in the VCS Standard, Verra changes the project status to inactive. Inactive projects
that were most recently listed as under development shall request listing as under validation to
be reactivated. Inactive projects that were most recently listed as under validation shall request

Registration and Issuance Process, v4.5

8

3 Pipeline Listing Process
registration in order to reactivate. Inactive projects shall apply the latest version of the
applicable methodology and VCS Program rules when reactivating.

3.1.18 Where Verra has reason to believe that false or misleading project information has been
submitted, Verra seeks clarification from the project proponent. Where the project proponent
cannot satisfactorily justify the information provided for the pipeline project, Verra reserves the
right to delist the project.
3.1.19 Where Verra deems the pipeline listing request is vexatious, frivolous, or an abuse of process,
Verra may reject the project without providing findings to the project.
3.1.20 Where Verra deems, at any point during the pipeline listing request process, that the project
does not clearly demonstrate conformance with the VCS Program rules, Verra communicates
the issue(s) to the project proponent and stops the review process. The project proponent may
submit updated documentation addressing the issue(s) and request that Verra resumes the
review. Where the project proponent fails to address the issue(s) within 12 months of such
communication the project status is changed to inactive (see 3.1.17).
3.1.21 Where Verra determines, at any point during the pipeline listing request process, that the
project does not conform with the VCS Program rules, Verra will:
1) Reject the project.
2) Change the status of the project to rejected by administrator.
3) Make the project page public and include information on the reason for rejection.

PROJECT REGISTRATION PROCESS

The following steps are required under the VCS Program to register a project and issue VCUs, and these
are presented in detail in this Section 4:
1) Project validation and verification
2) Registration and verification approval request
3) Project review
4) Project registration and initial VCU issuance
5) Periodic VCU issuance
6) VCU retirements and cancelations
7) Project maintenance
For the purposes of this document, the project registration process refers to all or any of these six
steps, as the case may be. The entity that initiates the project registration process may terminate the
process at any one of these steps if it decides it does not want to register the project or have VCUs
issued.

4.1 Step 1: Project Validation and Verification
The project shall be validated, and the GHG emission reductions or carbon dioxide removals verified as
set out in Diagram 4 below.

Registration and Issuance Process, v4.5

10

4 Project Registration Process
Diagram 4: Validation of Project and Verification of Reductions or Removals

Documents include:

Project proponent submits documentation
to validation/verification body

1) Project description
2) Evidence of project ownership

3) Other, as required by VVB

Validation/verification body assesses
project for validation

Validation/verification body provides
project proponent with validation report
and validation representation

1) Monitoring report
2) Other, as required by VVB

Validation/verification body assesses GHG
emission reductions or removals for

representation

4.1.1

The requirements for validation and verification, including the requirements for validation/
verification bodies, are set out in the VCS Standard and the VCS Program Guide. Projects shall
complete validation prior to requesting registration and complete verification prior to
requesting verification approval. The process for requesting registration and verification

Registration and Issuance Process, v4.5

11

4 Project Registration Process
approval, including the documents required to be submitted for each type of request, are set
out in Section 4.2 below.
4.1.2

Where a verification period includes more than one calendar year, the Verra Registry will
display separate vintages for each calendar year within one verification period.

Note – For AFOLU ARR and IFM projects with harvesting, if any year within the verification period has a
negative number of reductions or removals, zero VCUs will be issued for that year and a net total
amount of VCUs will be issued in the next year that sufficient reductions and removals are achieved to
compensate for the negative year(s).
Box 1. Example of VCU issuance in separate vintages
For example, where the verification period is 1 January 2020 to 30 June 2021, the project proponent would
have one VCU issuance record for the 2020 VCUs and a separate VCU issuance record for the 2021 VCUs.
The VCUs assigned each vintage would be based on the breakdown of reductions and removals in the
monitoring report. The two vintages would be 1 January 2020 – 31 December 2020 and 1 January 2021 – 30
June 2021.

4.2

Step 2: Registration and Verification Approval

The project is presented to the Verra Registry for registration and verification approval as set out in
Diagram 5 below.
Diagram 5: Project Registration Request

4.2.1

The only entities that may initiate the project registration process are the project proponent, an
entity to which the project proponent has assigned sole right to the reductions or removals for

Registration and Issuance Process, v4.5

12

4 Project Registration Process
the entire project crediting period, or the authorized representative of either of these entities.
No other entity can initiate the project registration process.
4.2.2

Registration of a project may be requested when the project has completed project validation
but before the first verification of reductions or removals.

4.2.3

Where the project is presented for registration without verification approval, the relevant
documents that shall be provided to the Verra Registry are:
1) The project description and registration representation.
2) The validation report and the validation representation.
3) The non permanence risk report, if applicable
4) Emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheets.
5) Proof of right or proof of contracting, where relevant.
6) Any annexes or supporting documents referenced in the project description.
7) Evidence of the date of project inactivity in another GHG program, where relevant.

4.2.4

Where the project is presented for verification approval, the relevant documents that should be
provided to the Verra Registry are:
1) The monitoring report and the issuance representation.
2) The verification report and the verification representation.
3) The non permanence risk report, if applicable
4) The emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheets.
5) Any annexes or supporting documents referenced in project documentation.
6) Proof of right or proof of contracting, where relevant.
8) Evidence and representation with respect to the cancelation of GHG credits under another
GHG program.

4.2.5

Where the project proponent requests registration and verification approval together, the
relevant documents that shall be provided to the Verra Registry are:
1) The project description and registration representation.
2) The validation report and the validation representation.
3) The non permanence risk report, if applicable
4) The monitoring report and the issuance representation.
5) The verification report and the verification representation.
6) The emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheets.

Registration and Issuance Process, v4.5

13

4 Project Registration Process
7) Any annexes or supporting documents referenced in project documentation.
8) Proof of right or proof of contracting, where relevant.
9) Evidence and representation with respect to the cancelation of GHG credits under another
GHG program.
10) Evidence of the date of project inactivity in another GHG program, where relevant.
4.2.6

Where the project proponent reassesses the project baseline as part of a verification approval
request, in addition to the documents listed in Section 4.2.4, the relevant documents that shall
be provided to the Verra Registry are:
1) An updated project description that includes updated Sections 1.14, 1.15, 1.16, 3.1, 3.2,
3.4, 4.1 – 4.4, 5.12 to reflect any changes as required in accordance with baseline
reassessment requirements set out in the VCS Standard, and any updates to the baseline
emissions quantifications.
2) A verification report that includes an assessment of the baseline reassessment in Section
3.4.

4.2.7

All documents submitted to Verra as part of the request, comments received, and documents
Verra issues as part of project request will be public, except for commercially sensitive
information and proof of contracting. Where a project document contains commercially
sensitive information, the project proponent may submit a public and a private version of the
document. The information in the private document shall meet the definition of “Commercially
Sensitive Information” in the VCS Program Definitions.

4.2.8

Projects participating in multiple Verra programs (e.g., the VCS Program and the CCB Program)
may submit joint templates only if the project proponent is making concurrent requests under
the VCS Program and the other program(s).

4.2.9

Where a project description deviation has been applied, and a revised project description is
issued, such project description shall be provided to the Verra Registry. Likewise, where a
project crediting period has been renewed, the revised project description and new validation
report and validation representation shall be provided to the Verra Registry.

4.2.10 The following shall apply with respect to the project proponent representations:
1) The Verra website provides the templates for the registration representation, issuance
representation and all other project proponent representations. The templates shall not be
altered other than to fill in the project specific details.

2 Section numbers are based on the VCS Project Description Template, v4.4.

Registration and Issuance Process, v4.5

14

4 Project Registration Process
2) The project proponent representations shall be properly executed as deeds in accordance
with applicable local laws and the organization’s own constitutional documents (e.g.,
signature by directors, requirement of company seals).
3) Where more than one individual or organization can claim rights in respect of the execution
of the project proponent representations, all such individuals and organizations shall
execute the project proponent representations, using the appropriate templates available
on the Verra website for projects with multiple project proponents, as applicable. Note that
such representations may be executed in any necessary number of counterparts.
4.2.11 Proof of contracting shall be provided to the Verra Registry where required, as set out in
Section 3.1.4. The project proponent or its authorized representative shall provide evidence of
the legal agreement between the project proponent (or other entity that has contracted the
validation/verification body to undertake validation) and the validation/verification body, in
relation to validation of the project. A final legal agreement, letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding or term sheet shall serve as proof of contracting. Such evidence of proof of
contracting shall be uploaded to the Verra Registry as a private document (for Verra internal
auditing purposes) and therefore will not be publicly available.
4.2.12 There is no need to submit proof of right to the Verra Registry where the project proponent or
its authorized representative is initiating the project registration process. Proof of right shall be
submitted to the Verra Registry where an entity other than the project proponent or its
authorized representative is initiating the project registration process. Evidencing proof of right
is as set out below.
4.2.13 The entity initiating the project registration process or its authorized representative shall
submit to the Verra Registry the legal agreement(s) transferring the right to the reductions or
removals for the entire project crediting period to it from the project proponent. Where there
are one or more intermediaries standing between the entity initiating the project registration
process and the project proponent, Verra checks all the legal agreements documenting the
complete chain of transfer of right to the reductions or removals to the entity from the project
proponent. Legal agreement(s) shall be in English or shall be an official translation of the legal
agreement(s).
4.2.14 In consideration of confidentiality, the entirety of the aforementioned legal agreement(s) need
not be shown, but Verra undertakes the checks set out in Table 1 (if submitting an official
translation of the legal agreement(s), only such information needs to be translated and shown
to Verra).

4.2.15 Projects registered under an approved GHG program (e.g., CDM) are only eligible to register
with the VCS Program after the date of project inactivity in another GHG program. For such
projects, the documentation required for the project registration process is the same as that
required for projects registering under the VCS Program only, but noting the following:
1) The project description from the approved GHG program and a project description using the
VCS Project Description Template with the relevant sections complete, as set out in the
VCS Standard, shall be submitted. The details of registration in the other GHG program and
the date of project inactivity in the other GHG program shall be included in the project
description. Verra notifies the other GHG program of the registration request and the stated
date of project inactivity in the other GHG program.
2) Where project proponents have received or are seeking credit for reductions and removals
from a project activity under the VCS Program, evidence requirements of no double
issuance as outlined in the VCS Standard shall apply. If the credits have been canceled, the

Registration and Issuance Process, v4.5

16

4 Project Registration Process
project proponent or its authorized representative shall also sign and submit to the Verra
Registry a VCU conversion representation.
3) AFOLU projects are subject to the rules and requirements for non-permanence risk analysis
and buffer withholding set out in Section 4.7.1. The buffer withholding percentage
determined by the AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk Tool shall be applied to the proportion of
GHG credits to be issued under the VCS Program (only).
4) Where a loss event or a reversal occurs, the project shall conform with the VCS Program
rules for reporting a loss event and holding and canceling credits set out in Section 5.3.
Such reporting, holding, and canceling shall apply to the proportion of credits (GHG credits
and buffer credits) granted to date under the VCS Program. For example, if 50 percent of
the total credits (GHG credits and, where applicable, buffer credits) granted to the project
to date have been granted under the VCS Program and a loss event results in a reversal of
reductions or removals achieved to date (in relation to which credits have been issued and
buffered), buffer credits would be canceled to cover 50 percent of the reversal.
4.2.16 Where the project is registered with both the VCS Program and the CDM, and where temporary
GHG credits have been issued to the project (i.e., temporary certified emission reductions
(tCERs) and long-term certified emission reductions (lCERs)) which have expired without having
been sold or retired, such credits may be issued under the VCS Program in accordance with the
requirements in Section 4.2.18. Where temporary credits have expired, evidence of their
expiration shall be provided.
4.2.17 Projects registered under a non-approved GHG program are only eligible to register with the
VCS Program after the date of project inactivity in the other GHG program. For such projects,
the documentation required for the project registration process is the same as required for
projects registering under the VCS Program only. The details of registration in the other GHG
program and the date of inactivity in the other GHG program shall be included in the project
description. Where project proponents have received or are seeking credit for reductions and
removals from a project activity under the VCS Program and another GHG program, evidence
requirements of no double issuance as outlined in the VCS Standard shall apply. Verra notifies
the other GHG program of the registration request and the stated date of project inactivity in
the other GHG program.
4.2.18 The VCS Program allows projects registered under an approved GHG program (e.g. CDM) to
cancel GHG credits issued under the approved GHG program and have them issued as VCUs in
the Verra Registry. Project activities shall be eligible under the VCS Program (i.e., included
within the scope of the VCS Program, as set out in the VCS Standard) and meet the conditions
set out in Appendix 1 in order to be eligible for such conversion. In such cases, the following
applies:
1) An official notification or other evidence of cancelation of the GHG credits under the
approved GHG program and a signed VCU conversion representation shall be provided to
the Verra Registry.
Registration and Issuance Process, v4.5

17

4 Project Registration Process
2) Where the project is registered under the CDM, those documents required for project
registration and Certified Emission Reduction (CER) issuance under the CDM shall be
provided to the Verra Registry. Verra creates a project record on the Verra Registry, noting
that such record shall have the status credits transferred from other GHG program. Such
projects are not considered to be registered under the VCS Program and are not eligible for
verification under the VCS Program without first conforming with the procedures for
registration with the VCS Program and an approved GHG program set out in Section 4.2.15.
3) Where the project is registered under the Joint Implementation (JI) program, the project
shall also be registered with the VCS Program before Emission Reduction Units (ERUs) may
be converted into VCUs.3 Following registration with the VCS Program, such projects shall
provide those documents required for ERU issuance under the JI program to the Verra
Registry.
4) Where the project is registered under the Climate Action Reserve (CAR), those documents
required for registration and Climate Reserve Tonne (CRT) issuance shall be provided to the
Verra Registry. Verra creates a project record on the Verra Registry, noting that such record
shall have the status credits transferred from other GHG program. Such projects are not
considered to be registered under the VCS Program and are not eligible for verification
under the VCS Program without first conforming with the procedures for registration with
the VCS Program and an approved GHG program set out in Section 4.2.15.
5) Where the project is an AFOLU project, the project shall also be registered with the VCS
Program before GHG credits issued under an approved GHG program may be converted
into VCUs. The buffer withholding percentage for such projects shall be applied to the
number of GHG credits being converted.
4.2.19 Where a project or project activity is seeking or planning to receive other forms of GHG credit
and/or GHG-related environmental credit, evidence requirements of no double claiming as
outlined in the VCS Standard shall apply.
4.2.20 For grouped projects and AFOLU projects with geographic areas characterized by one or more
geodetic polygons, the project proponent shall provide the geodetic information to the Verra
Registry in the format specified in the VCS Standard.
4.2.21 For grouped projects, AFOLU projects, and other projects with risk of reversal or loss, the
project proponent shall submit monitoring and verification reports in chronological order.
4.2.22 The Verra website maintains information on validation/verification bodies, and Verra checks
the following:

3 The flexibility inherent within the JI program (e.g., use of an approved methodology not required) means it is necessary for JI

projects to register with the VCS Program in order to determine whether ERUs issued to such projects are eligible for
conversion into VCUs.

Registration and Issuance Process, v4.5

18

4 Project Registration Process
1) The validation/verification body that conducted validation of the project was accredited for
the relevant sectoral scope for validation at the date(s) on which the validation report and
validation representation were issued.
2) The validation/verification body that conducted verification of the project was accredited
for the relevant sectoral scope for verification at the date(s) on which the verification report
and verification representation were issued.
4.2.23 The Project Registration Request Review Fee shall be paid before Verra will process the project
registration request.

4.3 Step 3: Project Review
Verra reviews all project requests. Verra will not begin the project review until the request is submitted
to the Verra Registry and Verra confirms all the relevant documents are complete. If all the relevant
documents are not submitted or the documents are not complete, Verra contacts the project proponent
(or authorized representative) to identify the outstanding issues.
As part of the review, Verra may identify non-conformances within project documentation, called
findings. Verra approves the request when no non-conformances are identified. Where nonconformances have been identified, the validation/verification body and the project proponent must
address the findings before the request can be approved, resulting in another round of review.
The project review process does not replace the validation or verification; rather, it checks that the
validation/verification body has appropriately assessed and has fully described how it has assessed
the project’s conformance with VCS Program rules. The project review process is set out in Diagram 6
below.
When submitting a verification approval request, it is not necessary to immediately request issuance of
VCUs. VCUs may be issued upon request to the Verra Registry after verification is approved.
Further details on the project review process are provided in this section.

Diagram 6: Review of Project Registration and Verification Approval Request

Project Review Process
4.3.1

Verra undertakes a review of the project documents to assess conformance with the VCS
Program rules and applied methodology. Where no findings are raised during the project
review, Verra notifies the project proponent (or its authorized representative) and
validation/verification body that the project registration or verification request is approved.
Where findings are raised as part of the project review:
1) Verra notifies the validation/verification body, copying the project proponent (or its
authorized representative) and provides a project review report detailing the findings as
part of the first review round.
2) The validation/verification body shall address the findings in the project review report.

Registration and Issuance Process, v4.5

20

4 Project Registration Process
4.3.2

The validation/verification body shall respond to the findings in the project review report, as
follows:
1) Undertake, or ensure that the project proponent undertakes, and validate or verify (as
appropriate) revisions to the project documents where necessary,
2) Provide a written response to each finding, and
3) Submit all revised documents to Verra including track change and clean versions.

4.3.3

Where the findings are addressed to the satisfaction of Verra, Verra approves the request and
notifies the project proponent (or authorized representative) and validation/verification body.

4.3.4

Where the findings are not addressed to the satisfaction of Verra, Verra may raise another
review round to the validation verification body with the unresolved findings, up to three review
rounds.
Note – For the purpose of determining adherence to deadlines with respect to methodology
validity and completion of validation and verification, the dates of the project documents
submitted under the initial registration or verification approval request will be used (rather
than the dates of the revised documents).

4 Project Registration Process

Project Request Denial Process
4.3.5

Verra may deny a project request at any point during the review process under the following:
1) Where documentation is deemed incomplete, of unsatisfactory quality, or where immediate
non-conformances with the VCS Program rules are identified.
2) The project proponent or validation/verification body significantly alters the project
documents outside the scope of the findings issued by Verra.
3) Where findings are not satisfactorily closed after three rounds of review.
4) No response is received from the validation/verification body within 60 days from the date
the project review report was issued.

4.3.6

Where a request is denied:
1) Verra notifies the project proponent and uploads the project review report (if applicable)
and a letter to the Verra Registry stating the reason that the request was denied.
2) Verra changes the registry status to the relevant denial status (e.g., registration request
denied).
3) A new request may be submitted after 90 days from the date of denial.

4.3.7

To submit a new request the project proponent or its authorized representative must:
1) Email registry@verra.org, stating the project is submitting a new request following a denial.
2) Submit all relevant project documents to the Verra Registry as set out in Sections 4.2.3,
4.2.5, and 4.2.5 and a letter to detailing the steps taken to address the reasons for denial.

4.3.8

Project proponents submitting a new registration request shall:
1) Pay the Project Registration Request Review Fee, which shall be paid before Verra
processes the new request.
2) Submit the new request no later than one year from the date the request was denied.
Where the new request is not submitted within one year of denial, the project is rejected,
and the status is changed to rejected by administrator.

4.3.9

Where the findings are not addressed to the satisfaction of Verra after two denials at
registration request, the project is rejected and the status is changed to rejected by
administrator.

4.3.10 Project proponents shall submit a new crediting period renewal request within one year of
denial, or the status is changed to inactive. Where the findings are not addressed to the
satisfaction of Verra after two denials of a crediting period renewal request, the project status
is changed to inactive.

Step 4: Project Registration and Initial VCU Issuance

The project is registered and the VCUs are issued on the Verra Registry as set out in Diagram 8.
Diagram 8: Project Registration and Initial VCU Issuance

4.4.1

Where the project is presented for registration without verification approval, the project
proponent shall upload all documents following the requirements in Sections 4.2.3 and 4.2.7.

4.4.2

Where the project is presented for registration and verification approval, the project proponent
shall upload all documents following the requirements in Sections 4.2.5 and 4.2.7.

4.4.3

The project’s geodetic co-ordinates shall be entered onto the project record on the Verra
Registry. The Verra Registry checks that there are no other projects within a five-kilometer

radius. Where there are projects within a five-kilometer radius. Verra confirms that the project
being presented for registration is unique and not one of the overlapping projects, noting that it
is possible to have two projects operated by the same project proponent at the same location
(they must be different activities described in separate project descriptions, with separate
validation and verification). Verra may do this on its own if sufficient information is available or
by contacting the validation/verification body of the project being presented for registration
who shall confirm that it is unique and not one of the overlapping projects. Where Verra is
unable to confirm uniqueness of the project, the project cannot be registered.
4.4.4

VCUs can be issued incrementally from a verification report (i.e., when the project proponent or
its authorized representative requests VCU issuance, it can request issuance of part of the
verification report volume and request issuance of the remaining volume at a later date). The
following shall apply:
1) The entity requesting VCU issuance shall instruct the Verra Registry that it is requesting
VCU issuance for only part of the verification report volume and shall specify the volume for
which it is requesting VCU issuance.
2) The VCU issuance levy and any fees charged by Verra are payable on the volume of VCUs
which are issued, not the total verification report volume.
3) Verra does not specify thresholds or timeframes on incremental VCU issuance (e.g., the
total number of incremental VCU issuances that can be made from a verification report and
the elapsed time between first and last VCU issuance from the verification report). Verra is
entitled to apply such thresholds and timeframes as it deems necessary.
4) The Verra Registry displays the total verification report volume, the volume of VCUs issued
to date and the history of VCU issuances with respect to the verification report.
5) The entity requesting VCU issuance does not have to request VCU issuance of the total
verification report volume (i.e., it can choose to only request VCU issuance for a part of the
verification report volume and never request issuance of the remaining verification report
volume).
6) VCUs are not subject to any discounting with respect to their fungibility. VCU owners,
programs or other climate change efforts that accept VCUs may apply a discount at their
own discretion.

4.4.5

Where the project has canceled GHG credits issued under an approved GHG program and is
having them issued as VCUs (as set out in Section 4.2.18), the project reference number under
the approved GHG program shall be noted on the project record on the Verra Registry.

4.4.6

The VCU issuance levy shall be collected by Verra before VCUs are deposited into an account.

4.4.7

The VCS Program allows VCUs to be labeled to designate that the VCS project has met the
requirements of another certification standard (certification labels), or that the VCUs are
eligible or approved for use in a national, sectoral, or investor-specific market (market labels).

Registration and Issuance Process, v4.5

25

4 Project Registration Process
The Verra website provides the list of current VCU labels and the procedure for attaining such
VCU labels.
4.4.8

To have VCUs labeled, project proponents shall submit documentation to the Verra Registry
demonstrating that a project has satisfied the requirements for the label for the entire VCS
vintage period for which VCU labels are requested. The covered period may consist of multiple
VCS vintage or verification periods. Labels may be applied retroactively, depending on the label
type.
1) For a certification label, the requirements for the label include the rules and requirements
of the other certification standard.
2) For a market label, the requirements for the label include any label-specific guidance and
any national, sectoral, or investor-specific requirements.

4.5

Step 5: Periodic VCU Issuance

There may be issuance of VCUs subsequent to the initial issuance of VCUs to the project as set out in
Diagram 9 below.

Registration and Issuance Process, v4.5

26

4 Project Registration Process
Diagram 9: Periodic VCU Issuance

4.5.1

All and any periodic VCU issuances shall be initiated by the project proponent stated on the
project record in the Verra Registry or its authorized representative. Where another entity wants
to become the project proponent (and therefore assume the roles and responsibilities of a
project proponent with respect to the Verra Registry), the process set out in Section 7 shall be

Registration and Issuance Process, v4.5

27

4 Project Registration Process
followed. The new project proponent on the project record in the Verra Registry or its authorized
representative can then initiate VCU issuance.

4.6

Step 6: VCU Retirements and Cancelations

The Verra Registry displays the status of every VCU issued under the VCS Program. VCUs may have a
status of active, retired or canceled. Note that VCU retirement and cancelation have specific meanings,
as set out in the VCS Program Definitions.
The process for retiring active VCUs is set out in Sections 4.6.1 - 4.6.4 below. The process for canceling
active VCUs is set out in Sections 4.6.5 - 4.6.8 below.
4.6.1

VCUs may be retired as set out in Diagram 10 below.

Diagram 10: VCU Retirement

Account holder or authorized
representative executes retirement in

4.6.2

All and any VCU retirements shall be initiated by the registry account holder or its authorized
representative.

4.6.3

The registry account holder or its authorized representative may execute a VCU retirement
through its Verra Registry account. The Verra Registry records the details of all VCU retirements.

4.6.4

VCUs can be retired incrementally from a registry accountholder’s VCU holdings (i.e., when the
VCU holder or its authorized representative requests VCU retirement, it can request retirement
of part of the VCU holdings and request retirement of any or all of the remaining holdings at a
later date). In such cases, the following shall apply:
1) The registry account holder or its authorized representative shall designate the specific set
of VCUs for retirement through its Verra Registry account.
2) Verra does not specify thresholds or timeframes on incremental VCU retirement (e.g., the
total number of incremental VCU retirements that can be made from a registry
accountholder’s VCU holdings and the elapsed time between first and last VCU retirement

Registration and Issuance Process, v4.5

28

4 Project Registration Process
from those holdings). Verra is entitled to apply such thresholds and timeframes as it deems
necessary.
4.6.5

VCUs may be canceled as set out in Diagram 11 below.

Diagram 11: VCU Cancelation

4.6.6

The registry account holder, its authorized representative, the other GHG program in which the
registry account holder is participating or Verra may initiate a VCU cancelation. Note that the
initiator and recipient of a VCU cancelation request depends on the specific circumstances of
the cancelation (e.g., where VCUs are being converted into another form of GHG credit, the
cancelation request may be submitted to Verra by the other GHG program in which the registry
account holder is participating).

4.6.7

The registry account holder or its authorized representative may be asked to confirm the details
of the VCU cancelation request.

4.6.8

VCUs are canceled in the Verra Registry and the Verra Registry records the details of all VCU
cancelations.

Verra updates record on the Verra
Registry

4.7.1

Where a project fails to submit a verification report to the Verra Registry within five years of its
last verification, the following applies:
1) Verra sends written communication to the project proponent to request evidence that the
project is still active despite not having verified.
2) The project proponent shall submit such evidence within one year of receiving the written
communication from Verra.
a) Evidence may take the form of a letter submitted by the project proponent to Verra and
should explain in detail the status of the project, including an explanation as to why the
project has not verified and, where relevant, why it should still be considered active.
b) The letter may be accompanied by any relevant documentation of activity
implementation (e.g., photographic evidence, monitoring reports, contract for
verification in the near future).
3) Where a letter is received, it shall be posted publicly to the Verra Registry and the project
status in the registry shall be changed to late to verify.
4) Where no letter is received, the project status shall still be changed to late to verify, but will
not benefit from an explanation being available to potential buyers and other stakeholders.
The project proponent is encouraged to submit an updated letter annually.
Note – Where a project has not verified because it has transitioned to another GHG program
(e.g., integrated into a government program), its project status shall be changed to project
transferred to other GHG program instead of late to verify.
Note – Where an AFOLU project fails to submit a verification report to the Verra Registry within
five, ten and fifteen years of its last verification, buffer credits are put on hold or canceled (and
the project status changed to inactive), as appropriate, per the requirements set out in Section
5.3.6, below.

4.7.2

Where the project proponent wishes to withdraw the project from the VCS Program (e.g., in

Registration and Issuance Process, v4.5

30

4 Project Registration Process
order to transfer the project to another GHG program), the following applies:
1) The project proponent shall submit a letter (in English) on its organization letterhead, to the
Verra Registry, requesting that the project be withdrawn. Such letter shall include the
project name, project ID, the reason for the withdrawal request and the signatures and
contact information of all project proponents.
2) Verra reviews the withdrawal request and may request additional information prior to
approving the request.
3) Upon approval, Verra updates the status of the project to withdrawn. The project
information shall remain publicly available on the Verra Registry, but the project will not be
able to issue VCUs.
4) In the case of an AFOLU project where VCUs have been previously issued, the following
applies:
a) The project shall not be eligible for any release of buffer credits.
b) Where Verra confirms that the project has registered with another GHG program, all
buffer credits associated with the project shall be canceled.
c) Where Verra is unable to confirm that the project has registered with another GHG
program, buffer credits shall be canceled over time in accordance with the rules set out
in Section 5.3.6 below.
5) Withdrawn projects may rejoin the VCS Program where the project proponent submits a
letter to the Verra Registry requesting same. Such letter shall include the information
specified in Section 4.7.1(1) above. Verra reviews the project to determine whether it is
eligible to rejoin the VCS Program and notifies the project proponent of the outcome of the
review. Where the project is eligible to rejoin the VCS Program, Verra updates the status of
the project accordingly. Where the project is not eligible to rejoin the VCS Program, the
project shall remain withdrawn.

4 AFOLU Pooled Buffer Account

5 AFOLU POOLED BUFFER ACCOUNT
The VCS Program addresses the non-permanence risk associated with AFOLU project activities by
requiring projects to set aside non-tradable buffer credits to cover unforeseen losses in carbon stocks.
The buffer credits from all projects are held in a single AFOLU pooled buffer account, which can be
drawn upon in the event of a reversal in carbon stocks in any individual project.

5.1 Assignment of Buffer Credits at First Request for Issuance
At first VCU issuance, buffer credits shall be deposited into the AFOLU pooled buffer account, in
accordance with the procedures below.
5.1.1

The number of credits to be deposited in the AFOLU pooled buffer account is determined by the
non-permanence risk report assessed by the validation/verification body(s), in accordance with
the requirements set out in the VCS Standard. The report establishes the non-permanence risk
rating, and this percentage is applied to the net change in the project’s carbon stocks (stated in
the verification report) to determine the number of credits to be deposited in the AFOLU pooled
buffer account.

5.1.2

Buffer credits are not issued a VCU serial number, nor are they considered to be VCUs. They are
not subject to the VCU issuance levy.

5.2

Assignment and Release of Buffer Credits at Subsequent Approved
Verification Requests

A portion of a project’s buffer credits may be released to incentivize continued verification, risk
mitigation, and recognize that certain project risks decrease over time.
5.2.1

Projects are eligible for buffer credit releases when the non-permanence risk rating in the latest
approved verification report remains the same or decreases from the previous verification
report. Buffer credit releases occur after the subsequent verification request is approved by
Verra. Project proponents may request a buffer release within 3 months after Verra approves a
verification request. The request must be sent via an email to registry@verra.org. Buffer credits
released from the AFOLU pooled buffer account will be issued as VCUs into the designated
Verra Registry account upon payment of the VCU issuance levy.

5.2.2

The first buffer credit release shall be no sooner than five years after the first verification report
was issued and approved by the registry for VCU issuance. Subsequent buffer credit releases
shall not occur more than once every five years, even if verification reports are issued more
frequently.

5.2.3

Where the five year interval set out in Section 5.2.2 has passed, and where the project’s nonpermanence risk rating of the latest approved verification period remains the same as the risk

Registration and Issuance Process, v4.5

32

4 AFOLU Pooled Buffer Account
rating of the previous approved verification report, a 15 percent “time release” of buffer credits
is applied. This 15 percent time release shall be applied to the total number of buffer credits
associated with the project to-date (i.e., the number of buffer credits previously held in the
AFOLU pooled buffer account plus the number of buffer credits newly deposited).
5.2.4

Where the project’s non-permanence risk rating of the latest approved verification report is
lower than the non-permanence risk rating at the previous verification report, the new risk
rating retroactively applies to all reductions and removals formerly verified.
Previously deposited buffer credits that exceed the updated withholding percentage will be
released and issued as VCUs where the five-year interval set out in Section 5.2.2 has passed.
A 15 percent “time release” shall also be applied to the total number of buffer credits
associated with the project to-date (i.e., the number of buffer credits previously held in the
AFOLU pooled buffer account plus the number of buffer credits newly deposited).

5.2.5

Projects are not eligible for buffer credit releases when the non-permanence risk rating of the
latest approved verification report is higher than the non-permanence risk rating of the
previous approved verification report.

5.3 Cancelation and Holding of Buffer Credits
Buffer credits are canceled from the AFOLU pooled buffer account where there are negative reductions
or removals associated with the project (as compared to the baseline), and are put on hold in certain
situations, as outlined in this section.
5.3.1

Where a loss event occurs (see the VCS Program Definitions for the definition of a loss event),
the project proponent shall:
1) Notify Verra via email within 30 days of discovering the loss event, and
2) Where VCUs have been previously issued, prepare and submit to registry@verra.org a loss
event report within two years of discovering the loss event. Projects that do not submit a
loss event report within two years of the loss event’s discovery date are not eligible to issue
further VCUs until the report is submitted. Verra puts AFOLU pooled buffer account credits
on hold, equivalent to the estimated loss in the loss event report.

5.3.2

When a loss event is detected during verification, the project proponent shall submit a loss
event report before verification approval is requested.

5.3.3

The loss event report shall:
1) Be prepared using the VCS Loss Event Report Template.
2) Include a conservative estimate of the loss of previously verified reductions and removals
due to losses in carbon stocks from the project. The estimate shall be based on monitoring
of the full area affected by the loss event.

Registration and Issuance Process, v4.5

33

4 AFOLU Pooled Buffer Account
3) Be accompanied by a complete loss event representation signed by the project proponent.
The template for the loss event representation is available on the Verra website.
4) Be verified by a validation/verification body. The verification may be completed as part of
the subsequent verification.
5.3.4

The following applies with respect to the verification report submitted after a loss event:
1) Where the net GHG benefit of the project for the verification period is negative, a reversal
has occurred (see the VCS Program Definitions for definition of reversal) and the following
applies:
a) Where the total reversal is less than the number of credits put on hold after the
submission of the loss event report, Verra cancels buffer credits equivalent to the
reversal. Any remaining buffer credits shall be released from their on-hold status
(though remain in the AFOLU pooled buffer account).
b) Where the reversal is greater than the number of credits put on hold after the
submission of the loss event report, the full amount of buffer credits put on hold with
respect to the submission of the loss event report shall be canceled, and additional
buffer credits from the AFOLU pooled buffer account shall be canceled to fully account
for the reversal.
2) Where the net GHG benefit for the verification period is positive (i.e., all losses have been
made up over the verification period taking into account project GHG emissions, removals
and leakage), a reversal has not occurred and buffer credits put on hold after the
submission of the loss event report shall be released from their on-hold status (but shall
remain in the AFOLU pooled buffer account).

5.3.5

The following applies with respect to the VCU issuance after a reversal:
1) Where the reversal is an unavoidable reversal (see the VCS Program Definitions for the
definition of unavoidable reversal) the following applies:
a) GHG credits shall be deposited in the AFOLU pooled buffer account in an amount
equivalent to the additional number of buffer credits canceled after the reversal, above
what has been previously contributed by the project. For example, if the project
previously contributed 100 buffer credits and 150 credits were canceled from the
AFOLU pooled buffer account after a reversal, the project would deposit 50 buffer
credits (to replenish the pool at large). Buffer credits deposited to replenish the pool
after a reversal (50 in the example above) shall never be eligible for release back to the
project.
b) Where further GHG credits are available for VCU issuance after replenishing the AFOLU
pooled buffer account, additional buffer credits shall be deposited in the AFOLU pooled
buffer account in accordance with Section 5.2 (applying the non-permanence risk
rating only to those remaining GHG credits eligible for VCU issuance).

Registration and Issuance Process, v4.5

34

4 AFOLU Pooled Buffer Account
2) Where the reversal is an avoidable reversal (see the VCS Program Definitions for the
definition of avoidable reversal), the following applies:
a) GHG credits shall be deposited in the AFOLU pooled buffer account in an amount
equivalent to the full reversal. No further VCUs will be issued to the project or any other
VCS project solely with the same project proponent, or combination of project
proponents, until the deficit is remedied.
b) Where further GHG credits are available for VCU issuance after replenishing the AFOLU
pooled buffer account, additional buffer credits shall be deposited in the AFOLU pooled
buffer account in accordance with Section 5.2 (applying the non-permanence risk
rating only to those remaining GHG credits available for VCU issuance).
5.3.6

Where a project fails to submit a verification report to the Verra Registry within five years of its
last verification 50 percent of the buffer credits associated with the project shall be put on
hold.

5.3.7

Where a project fails to submit a verification report within ten years, all its remaining buffer
credits shall be put on hold.

5.3.8

Where no subsequent verification report has been submitted within a period of 15 years, and
the project crediting period has not yet expired, buffer credits are canceled from the AFOLU
pooled buffer account in an amount equivalent to the total number of VCUs issued to the
project (including buffer credits put on hold) and the project’s status will be changed to
inactive.

5.3.9

Inactive projects shall apply the latest version of the applicable methodology and VCS Program
rules and reassess the baseline when reactivating.

5.3.10 Where a project has not verified because it has transitioned to another GHG program (e.g.,
integrated into a government program), its status will be changed to project transferred to other
GHG program instead of inactive, and the remaining balance of buffer credits is canceled.
5.3.11 Where buffer credits are put on hold because a project does not submit a verification report
within five years of the previous verification, the project may re-claim buffer credits. A new
verification report shall be submitted prior to the expiration of the project crediting period.
Verra reassigns buffer credits that have been put on hold in accordance with the procedure set
out in Section 5.1.1 above. The remaining balance of buffer credits associated with a project
will be canceled at the end of the project crediting period.
5.3.12 Where a project has a crediting period of less than 40 years, and an avoidable reversal (see the
VCS Program Definitions for the definition of avoidable reversal) occurs within 40 years of the
project’s start date, the following applies:
1) The project proponent shall submit a loss event report to the Verra Registry within two
years of reversal detection. The loss event report shall meet the requirements of Section
5.3.3.
Registration and Issuance Process, v4.5

35

4 AFOLU Pooled Buffer Account

2) The project proponent shall deposit GHG credits in the AFOLU pooled buffer account in an
amount equivalent to the full reversal. No further VCUs will be issued to any other VCS
project solely with the same project proponent, or combination of project proponents, until
the deficit is remedied.

6.1

Process

6.1.1

Verra may, at its discretion, review registered projects and issued VCUs where it has concerns
about adherence of the project to the VCS Program rules and the applied methodology. A
review may be triggered by any of the following:
1) A validation/verification body performing a verification of a registered project identifies an
error or quality issue in a previous validation or verification.
2) A project proponent identifies an error or quality issue after the registration or issuance of
the project.
3) A stakeholder has concerns about a registered project 4.
4) Verra itself identifies an error or quality issue, as part of routine operations.

6.1.2

Where a review is triggered, Verra notifies the project proponent (or its authorized
representative) and the relevant validation/verification body of the review and may suspend
further VCU issuance while the review is performed.

6.1.3

Where non-conformances are identified during the review, the validation/verification body shall
provide a written response to findings in a project review report (e.g., corrective action requests
or clarification requests) issued by Verra. Verra also suspends further VCU issuance, where it
has not already done so.
Note – Where the relevant validation/verification body is unable to respond due to reasons
such as a cease of operations or accreditation, Verra may solicit a response to the findings
from alternative entities such as the project proponent or another validation/verification body.

6.1.4

The follow-up actions of the validation/verification body and/or project proponent shall depend
on whether the relevant validation or verification was completed before, on or after 8 April
2014, and shall be as set out in Tables 3 and 4 below. In all cases, the relevant
validation/verification body shall undertake a root cause analysis to identify why such quality
issues occurred.

2) Any compensation for excess VCU issuance shall be through the following, with Verra using
reasonable efforts to work with the project proponent to ensure that any adverse impacts
on the project proponent are minimized to the extent possible.
a) Where the excess VCUs remain in the project proponent’s Verra Registry account and it
can be demonstrated that they have not been used for offsetting purposes, immediate
cancelation of the VCUs.
b) Replacement of VCUs through immediate cancelation from subsequent issuances of
VCUs to the project.
c) Purchase by the project proponent of an equivalent number of replacement VCUs, and
cancelation of same, within 60 business days of receiving formal Verra notification of
such required action.
3) Where the project proponent fails to compensate for excess VCU issuance, Verra may take

7.2.1

Project proponents may join or leave a project subsequent to project listing or registration.
Such accession and release is handled via representations made by acceding entities and
project proponents as follows:
1) Where an entity wants to join a project, it and the existing project proponent(s) shall sign an
accession representation, which shall be prepared using the VCS Deed of Accession
Template and properly executed as a deed in accordance with applicable local laws and the
organization’s own constitutional documents. Where more than one entity wants to join the
project, one accession representation shall be signed for each acceding entity.
2) Where a project proponent wants to leave a project (i.e., give up its rights and obligations in
respect of the project), it, the remaining project proponent(s) and Verra shall sign a partial
release representation, which shall be prepared using the VCS Deed of Partial Release
Template and properly executed as a deed in accordance with applicable local laws and the
organization’s own constitutional documents. Where more than one project proponent

7 Further Information
wants to be released from the project, one partial release representation shall be signed
for each project proponent that is leaving. Note that a project shall always have at least
one project proponent, so there shall always be at least one remaining registration
representor (project proponent) that signs the partial release representation.
3) The accession and/or partial release representations shall be submitted to the Verra
Registry, which uploads the accession and/or partial release representations to the Verra
Registry and updates the project record to reflect the change in project proponent.
4) Once this process is complete, only the new project proponent or its authorized
representative are permitted to initiate subsequent VCU issuance.
Note – Where a project has one project proponent only and the project proponent wants to
leave the project in favor of another entity, this is handled by having the new entity accede to
the project via an accession representation and the original project proponent released from
the project via a release representation.

7.3 Comments Received Outside of a Public Comment Period
7.3.1

Stakeholders may submit comments outside of the 30-day public comment period. Such
comments shall be submitted to secretariat@verra.org.

7.3.2

Comments received outside of the 30-day public comment period are sent to the project
proponent and the validation/verification body performing the next validation or verification,
where known. Where the validation/verification body is not known, Verra sends the comments
to the project proponent and the project proponent shall provide the comments and any
actions taken or comments responses to the validation/verification body.

7.3.3

Project proponents shall address any comments received while validation or verification is
ongoing (e.g., a comment received outside of the 30-day public comment period but while the
validation is ongoing must be addressed as part of validation). Any comments received when a
validation or verification is not ongoing shall be addressed at the subsequent validation or
verification unless Verra determines a review of project documents is required, as described in
Section 6 above.

7.3.4

The comments are made public with the rest of the public documents at each request.

Appendix 1 Eligibility conditions for Conversion of GHG Credits into VCUs

APPENDIX 1 ELIGIBILITY CONDITIONS FOR
CONVERSION OF GHG CREDITS INTO
VCUS
This appendix provides the eligibility conditions (effective dates) for credit conversions for credits
issued to projects and CPAs registered under another GHG program, with activities included within the
scope of the VCS Program (see VCS Standard, Section 2.1). These conditions remain unchanged from
the 5 February 2021 Errata and Clarifications (for GHG credits issued to standalone projects) and from
the 19 April 2022 update to the VCS Program rules and requirements (for GHG credits issued to CPAs).
These conditions are copied to this appendix for greater ease of use.

GHG Credits issued to standalone projects, seeking conversion into VCUs
GHG credits issued to projects registered under another GHG program, with activities that are included
within the scope of the VCS Program are only eligible for conversion into VCUs where one of the
following is demonstrated:5
A1.1

For GHG credits issued to a project that does not include afforestation and/or reforestation
activities:
1) The project shall have an original project crediting period start date on or after 1 January
2016 with another GHG program; or
2) Where the project has an original project crediting period start date from 1 January 2013 to
31 December 2015, the project shall have issued credits during the period 1 January 2016
to 5 March 2021, or shall have a status of “issuance requested” on the relevant GHG
program registry by 5 March 2021.

A1.2

For GHG credits issued to a project with afforestation and/or reforestation activities, the project
shall have been registered under another GHG program on or after 1 January 2013. 6 Further,

5 GHG credits are deemed to have met these timelines where Verra confirmed (in writing, to the project proponent or an

authorized representative) the credits’ eligibility on or before 4 February 2021.
6 Note that for a project seeking to convert GHG credits to VCUs, a project with activities within the Agriculture, Forestry,

and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector shall register under the VCS Program, and the project shall be required to deposit
credits into the AFOLU pooled buffer account in accordance with the AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk Tool. Such a project
shall first register under the VCS Program before any GHG credits may be converted into VCUs, given the risk of nonpermanence (see VCS Registration and Issuance Process, v4.3 Section 4.2.16(5)).

GHG credits issued to CDM CPAs registered under another GHG program, with activities that are
included within the scope of the VCS Program are only eligible for conversion into VCUs where one of
the following is demonstrated:8
A1.5

For GHG credits issued to a CDM CPA that does not include afforestation and/or reforestation
activities:
1) The CPA shall be part of a Program of Activities (PoA) with an original program crediting
period start date on or after 1 January 2016; or
2) Where the CPA is part of a Program of Activities (PoA) with an original program crediting
period start date from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015 and where the CPA has an
original crediting period start date from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015, the CPA
shall have issued credits during the period 1 January 2016 to 5 March 2021, or shall have
a status of “issuance requested” by 5 March 2021; or
3) Where the CPA is part of a PoA with an original program crediting period start date from 1
January 2013 to 31 December 2015 and where the CPA has an original crediting period
start date on or after 1 January 2016, no prior credit issuance is required.

A1.6

1 Introduction

1 INTRODUCTION
The VCS Standard provides a global standard for GHG emission reduction and removal projects and
programs. It uses as its core the requirements set out in ISO 14064-2, ISO 14064-3, and ISO 14065.
The three principal documents of the program are the VCS Program Guide, the VCS Standard, and the
VCS Methodology Requirements. The VCS Program Guide describes the rules and requirements
governing the VCS Program and further describes the constituent parts of the program such as the
project and program registration process, the Verra Registry, the methodology development and review
process, and the accreditation requirements for validation/verification bodies. The VCS Standard
provides the requirements for developing projects and programs, as well as the requirements for
validation, monitoring, and verification of projects, programs, and GHG emission reductions and carbon
dioxide removals. The VCS Methodology Requirements provide the rules and requirements for
developing new VCS methodologies. The VCS Program Guide should be read before using the VCS
Standard or the VCS Methodology Requirements.
Verra recognizes the kind agreement of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO,
www.iso.org) to allow the inclusion of critical clauses of ISO 14064-2 and ISO 14064-3 in the VCS
Program documentation to facilitate comprehension.

1.1

Version

All information about version control under the VCS Program is contained in the VCS Program Guide.
This document will be updated from time-to-time, and readers shall ensure that they are using the most
current version of the document. Where external documents are referenced (e.g., The 2019
Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories), and when such documents are
updated, the most recent version of the document shall be used.
Previous versions of the VCS Program may have included different rules and requirements than those
set out in this version. Previous versions of the VCS Standard and other VCS Program documents are
archived and available on the Verra website. Appendix 3 Document History and Effective Dates,
contains information on changes made from previous versions and when those changes take effect.
These changes are also described in the Summary of Effective Dates document that corresponds with
each update, which is available on the Verra website.

1.2

Language

1.2.1

The operating language of the VCS Program is English. The project and program description,
validation report, monitoring report, verification report, and all other documentation (including
all and any appendices) required under the VCS Program shall be in English.

2 VCS PROGRAM SPECIFIC ISSUES
2.1

Scope of the VCS Program

2.1.1

The scope of the VCS Program includes:
1) The seven Kyoto Protocol greenhouse gases.
2) Ozone-depleting substances (ODS).
3) Project activities supported by a methodology approved under the VCS Program through the
methodology development and review process.
4) Project activities supported by a methodology approved under an approved GHG program,
unless explicitly excluded (see the Verra website for exclusions).
5) Jurisdictional REDD+ programs and nested REDD+ projects as set out in the Jurisdictional
and Nested REDD+ (JNR) Requirements.

2.1.2

The scope of the VCS Program excludes projects that can reasonably be assumed to have
generated GHG emissions primarily for the purpose of their subsequent reduction, removal, or
destruction.

2.1.3

The VCS Program also excludes the following project activities under the circumstances
indicated in Table 1, below.
Table 1: Excluded Project Activities

2.2

Principles

2.2.1

The application of principles is fundamental in ensuring that GHG-related information is a true
and fair account. The principles below shall provide the basis for, and shall guide the
application of, the VCS Program rules and requirements.
Principles taken from ISO 14064-2
Relevance
Select the GHG sources, sinks, reservoirs, data, and methodologies appropriate to the needs of
the intended user.
Completeness
Include all relevant GHG emissions and removals. Include all relevant information to support
criteria and procedures.
Consistency
Enable meaningful comparisons in GHG-related information.
Accuracy
Reduce bias and uncertainties as far as is practical.
Transparency
Disclose sufficient and appropriate GHG-related information to allow intended users to make
decisions with reasonable confidence.
Conservativeness
Use conservative assumptions, values, and procedures to ensure that GHG emission
reductions or carbon dioxide removals are not overestimated.
Note – Accuracy should be pursued as far as possible, but the hypothetical nature of
baselines, the high cost of monitoring of some types of GHG emissions reductions and carbon
dioxide removals, and other limitations make accuracy difficult to attain in many cases. In
these cases, conservativeness may serve as a moderator to accuracy in order to maintain the
credibility of project and program GHG quantification.

2.3

Timing of Crediting

2.3.1

Verified Carbon Units (VCUs) are not issued under the VCS Program for GHG emission
reductions or carbon dioxide removals that have not been verified.

2.3.2

Project activities are eligible for immediate crediting of future avoided emissions under the
conditions set out below, which shall be addressed at the level of the methodology:
1) The project immediately avoids future streams of GHG emissions as a result of an upfront
intervention that permanently precludes further emissions from the source. VCUs shall be
issued only after such an intervention has occurred and the GHG emission reductions have
been verified. Examples of such activities include projects that destroy chlorofluorocarbons
4

2 VCS Program Specific Issues
recovered from refrigeration equipment thereby immediately precluding their future release
into the atmosphere, and composting projects that divert organic waste from landfill sites
thereby immediately precluding future methane emissions. Reduced Emissions from
Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) projects do not qualify for immediate crediting
because future streams of GHG emissions are not permanently precluded.
2) The physical processes that would generate GHG emissions in the absence of an
intervention are well-understood, stable, and quantifiable. Models used to simulate such
processes shall meet the requirements for such models set out in the VCS Methodology
Requirements. Any default factors associated with input parameters shall meet the
requirements set out for such default factors in the VCS Methodology Requirements.
3) VCUs may be issued only for GHG emissions avoided over a ten-year period, even if such
GHG emissions are likely to have continued over a longer period of time under the baseline
scenario.
For example, a composting project that diverts organic waste from a landfill site may be
eligible for crediting (in relation to a specific amount of composted organic waste) for the
GHG emissions that would have occurred at the landfill site over a ten-year period, and any
emissions that would have occurred beyond the ten-year period (in relation to the specific
amount of composted organic waste) are not eligible. Note that in this particular example,
the ten-year rule applies to the specific amount of composted organic waste, and the usual
rules on the duration of the project and project crediting period still apply.
2.3.3

ODS projects are eligible for immediate crediting of future avoided emissions, and
methodologies may use such a crediting model.
Note – Crediting of ODS projects shall still be in relation to the baseline scenario. In many
cases, methodologies will credit projects for all of the ODS destroyed by the project (minus any
project emissions and leakage). However, it is possible that projects could destroy ODS from
existing stockpiles and only a portion of the ODS would have been emitted under the baseline
scenario. For example, if the baseline scenario includes the use of the ODS to service existing
equipment and a certain proportion of such ODS would be recovered and destroyed at the end
of that equipment’s life (whether voluntarily or due to regulation), then the volume of credits
granted to the project shall reflect this.

2.4

AFOLU and GCS Non-Permanence Risk and Pooled Buffer Accounts

2.4.1

Non-permanence risk in Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU) and Geologic Carbon
Storage (GCS) projects is addressed through the use of a project risk analysis, using the AFOLU
Non-Permanence Risk Tool (NPRT) and the GCS NPRT, respectively. These tools determine the
number of credits to be deposited in the AFOLU pooled buffer account or the GCS pooled buffer
account, respectively. The pooled buffer accounts hold non-tradable buffer credits to cover the
non-permanence risk associated with AFOLU and GCS projects.
Buffer credits are canceled to cover carbon known or believed to be lost. As such, the VCUs
already issued to projects that subsequently fail are not canceled and do not have to be “paid
5

2 VCS Program Specific Issues
back.” All VCUs issued to AFOLU and GCS projects (as with all projects) are permanent.2 The
VCS approach provides environmental integrity because the AFOLU and GCS pooled buffer
accounts will always maintain an adequate surplus to cover unanticipated losses from
individual project failures, and the net GHG benefits across the entire pool of AFOLU and GCS
projects will be greater than the total number of VCUs issued.
The full rules and procedures for AFOLU and GCS projects with respect to non-permanence risk
are set out in Sections 3.2 and the GCS Requirements, respectively.
2.4.2

The AFOLU and GCS pooled buffer accounts are subject to periodic reconciliation.
Reconciliation is based on a review of existing AFOLU and GCS verification reports and an
assessment of project performance. This process will identify the projects that have failed or
underperformed and will seek to identify their common characteristics. The risk analysis criteria
and buffer withholding percentages set out in the AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk Tool and the
GCS Non-Permanence Risk Tool will be adjusted accordingly to ensure that there are always
sufficient buffer credits in the AFOLU and GCS pooled buffer accounts to cover project losses.
Any changes to the tool will not be retroactive (i.e., they will apply only to future nonpermanence risk assessments).

2.4.3

Project risk analyses will be subject to periodic review by Verra. This process consists of a
review of a sample of AFOLU and GCS project risk reports to identify any inconsistencies in the
process and application of the AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk Tool and the GCS NonPermanence Risk Tool, and the assessment of the same by validation/verification bodies. The
risk analysis criteria and risk ratings set out in the tool may be adjusted, to ensure consistent
and accurate application of the tool. Any changes to the tool will not be retroactive (i.e., they
will apply only to subsequent non-permanence risk analyses).

2.5

AFOLU Leakage Assessments

2.5.1

Project market leakage assessments will be subject to periodic review by Verra. This process
consists of a review of a sample of AFOLU projects’ leakage assessments to identify any
inconsistencies in the process and application of the leakage requirements in Sections 3.15.8–
3.15.10, methodologies, and the VCS Methodology Requirements, and assessment of same by
validation/verification bodies. The leakage requirements may be adjusted to ensure consistent
and accurate application. Any changes to the leakage requirements will not be retroactive (i.e.,
they will apply only to subsequent leakage assessments).

2 Notwithstanding circumstances in which VCUs can be canceled in accordance with the Registration and Issuance Process,

Section 6.

3 Project Requirements

3 PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
This section sets out the rules and requirements for projects under the VCS Program. Specific
requirements for AFOLU and ODS projects are set out throughout this section to address unique
circumstances for these project types. GCS project requirements are set out in the GCS Requirements.
To complete the VCS certification process, projects must demonstrate how they meet the rules and
requirements set out below. Projects must also demonstrate how they have applied an eligible
methodology in full. Projects demonstrate their conformance with the VCS Program rules and the
applied methodology through the validation and verification processes, which are defined in Section 4
below. Once projects complete the validation and verification processes, they become eligible to
request registration and VCU issuance. Note that the full process for requesting project registration and
VCU issuance is set out in the Registration and Issuance Process.

3.1

General Requirements

Concept
Establishing a consistent and standardized certification process is critical to ensuring the integrity of
VCS projects. Accordingly, certain high-level requirements must be met by all projects, as set out below.

Requirements
3.1.1

Projects shall meet all applicable rules and requirements set out under the VCS Program,
including this document. Projects shall be guided by the principles set out in Section 2.2.1.

3.1.2

Projects shall apply methodologies eligible under the VCS Program. Methodologies shall be
applied in full, including the full application of any tools or modules referred to by a
methodology, noting the exception set out in Section 3.14.1. The list of methodologies and
their validity periods is available on the Verra website.

3.1.3

Projects shall apply the latest version of the applicable methodology in all cases unless a grace
period applies to the project as set out in 3.22 below. Projects shall update to the latest version
of the methodology when reassessing the baseline or renewing a crediting period.

3.1.4

Projects and the implementation of project activities shall not lead to the violation of any
applicable law, regardless of whether or not the law is enforced.

3.1.5

Where projects apply methodologies that permit the project proponent its own choice of model
(see the VCS Program Definitions for the definition of model), the model shall meet the
requirements set out in the VCS Methodology Requirements, and it shall be demonstrated at
validation that the model is appropriate to the project circumstances (i.e., use of the model will
lead to an appropriate quantification of GHG emission reductions or carbon dioxide removals).
7

3 Project Requirements
3.1.6

Where projects apply methodologies that permit the project proponent to choose a third-party
default factor or standard to ascertain GHG emission data and any supporting data for
establishing baseline scenarios and demonstrating additionality, such default factor or
standard shall meet the requirements set out in the VCS Methodology Requirements.

3.1.7

Where the rules and requirements under an approved GHG program conflict with the rules and
requirements of the VCS Program, the rules and requirements of the VCS Program shall take
precedence.

3.1.8

Where projects apply methodologies from approved GHG programs, they shall conform with any
specified capacity limits (see the VCS Program Definitions for the definition of capacity limit)
and any other relevant requirements set out with respect to the application of the methodology
and/or tools referenced by the methodology under those programs.

3.1.9

Where Verra issues new VCS Program rules, the effective dates of these requirements are set
out in Appendix 3 Document History and Effective Dates or equivalent for other program
documents, and are listed in a companion Summary of Effective Dates document which
corresponds with each update.

3.2

AFOLU-Specific Matters

Concept
AFOLU projects may encounter unique circumstances related to project implementation, monitoring
and other matters. This section sets out high-level requirements related to such AFOLU-specific
matters. Note that additional AFOLU-specific requirements are also set out throughout this document.

Requirements
General
3.2.1

There are currently six AFOLU project categories eligible under the VCS Program, as defined in
Appendix 1 Eligible AFOLU Project Categories below: afforestation, reforestation and
revegetation (ARR), agricultural land management (ALM), improved forest management (IFM),
reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD), avoided conversion of
grasslands and shrublands (ACoGS), and wetland restoration and conservation (WRC). Further
specification with respect to eligible activities which may be included within methodologies
approved under the VCS Program can be found in the VCS Methodology Requirements.

3.2.2

Where projects are located within a jurisdiction covered by a jurisdictional REDD+ program,
project proponents shall follow the requirements in this document and the requirements
related to nested projects set out in the Jurisdictional and Nested REDD+ Requirements.

3.2.3

Where an implementation partner is acting in partnership with the project proponent, the
implementation partner shall be identified in the project description. The implementation
8

3 Project Requirements
partner shall identify its roles and responsibilities with respect to the project, including but not
limited to implementation, management, and monitoring of the project, over the project
crediting period.
3.2.4

The project proponent shall demonstrate that project activities that lead to the intended GHG
benefit have been implemented during each verification period in accordance with the project
design. Where no new project activities have been implemented during a verification period,
project proponents shall demonstrate that previously implemented project activities continued
to be implemented during the verification period (e.g., forest patrols or improved agricultural
practices of community members).

3.2.5

For all IFM, Avoiding Planned Deforestation (APD) (except where the agent is unknown),
Restoring Wetland Ecosystems (RWE), Avoiding Planned Wetland Degradation (APWD), Avoiding
Planned Conversion (APC), and ALM project types, the project proponent shall, for the duration
of the project, reassess the baseline every ten years. For all Avoiding Unplanned Deforestation
and Degradation (AUDD) (where the baseline is not allocated from jurisdictional level data),
APD (where the agent is unknown), Avoiding Unplanned Conversion (AUC), and Avoiding
Unplanned Wetland Degradation (AUWD) project types, the project proponent shall, for the
duration of the project, reassess the baseline every six years. For Avoiding Unplanned
Deforestation projects where the baseline is allocated from jurisdictional level data, the initial
project baseline validity period may be as little as one year but no more than seven years. The
second and subsequent project baseline validity periods shall be no more than six years. The
project proponent shall reassess the baseline at the end of each baseline validity period.

3.2.6

The following shall apply with respect to the baseline reassessment:
1) The latest version of the VCS Program rules (including the latest version of the VCS
Standard) and applied methodology or its replacement shall be applied at the time of
baseline reassessment. The grace periods for using the previous version of a methodology
are set out in Section 3.22 and in the document history section of each VCS Program
document.
2) The baseline shall be reassessed in accordance with the timelines in Section 3.2.5 above
and shall be validated at the same time as the subsequent verification.
3) The reassessment will capture changes in the drivers and/or behavior of agents that cause
the change in land use, hydrology, sediment supply and/or land or water management
practices and changes in carbon stocks, all of which shall then be incorporated into revised
estimates of the rates and patterns of land-use change and estimates of baseline
emissions.3

3 Project Requirements
4) The validity of the original baseline scenario shall be reassessed. Such assessment shall
include an evaluation of the impact of new relevant national and/or sectoral policies and
circumstances on the validity of the baseline scenario. If still valid, the GHG emissions
associated with the original baseline scenario shall be reassessed for the new baseline
validity period following the provisions of the applied methodology. If no longer valid, the
current baseline scenario shall be established in accordance with the VCS Program rules.
5) Ex-ante baseline projections beyond the baseline reassessment period specified in Section
3.2.5 above are not required.
6) Sections 1.14, 3.1-3.4, Section 4 and Section 54 of the project description shall be updated
to reflect any changes as described in Section 3.2.6(3) and any updates to the baseline
emissions quantifications.
3.2.7

The following shall apply with respect to ALM baseline reassessment:
1) For projects that set their baseline using historical management data specific to the project
lands at validation, the historical baseline shall be compared to published data on current
common practice in the project region. If there is a significant difference between the
historical baseline and current common practice, the project baseline shall be updated to
reflect current common practice in the project region at each baseline reassessment event.
2) For projects that set their baseline using regional data on common practice (i.e., data not
specific to the project lands), the baseline shall be updated to reflect current practices at
each baseline reassessment event using similar datasets (e.g., agricultural census data) as
those used to establish the baseline at validation.
3) ALM projects focusing exclusively on reducing N 2O, CH4 and/or fossil-derived CO2
emissions (i.e., those that do not include soil organic carbon stocks) are exempted from the
10-year baseline reassessment requirement.

3.2.8

Where ARR, ALM, IFM or REDD project activities occur on wetlands, the project shall adhere to
both the respective project category requirements and the WRC requirements, unless the
expected emissions from the soil organic carbon pool or change in the soil organic carbon pool
in the project scenario is deemed below de minimis or can be conservatively excluded as set
out in the VCS Methodology Requirements, in which case the project shall not be subject to the
WRC requirements.

3.2.9

The project boundary for a WRC project shall include CH4 emissions sources for all WRC
activities and N2O emissions sources for RWE activities, unless deemed de minimis or evidence
is provided that it is conservative to exclude these sources.

Non-Permanence Risk

4 Section numbers are based on the VCS Project Description Template, v4.4

10

3 Project Requirements
3.2.10 Projects shall prepare a non-permanence risk report in accordance with the AFOLU NonPermanence Risk Tool at validation and verification. The non-permanence risk report shall be
prepared using the AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk Assessment Calculator and shall be included
as an annex to the project description or monitoring report, as applicable, or provided as a
stand-alone document.
3.2.11 Projects shall have a minimum of a 40-year project longevity.
3.2.12 Projects with tree harvesting shall demonstrate that the permanence of their carbon stock is
maintained and shall put in place management systems to ensure the carbon against which
VCUs are issued is not lost during a final cut with no subsequent replanting or regeneration.
Post-harvest replanting and subsequent harvest plans shall be included in a government- or
professional forester-approved forest management plan.
3.2.13 WRC projects shall ensure that the permanence of their soil carbon stock will be maintained by
demonstrating that project areas are not subject to erosion, migration, or inundation.
3.2.14 The maximum quantity of GHG emission reductions that may be sought by a WRC project is
limited to the difference between project and baseline scenario after a 100-year time frame.
Projects unable to establish and demonstrate a difference greater than 5% between the
baseline and project for at least 100 years are not eligible. These criteria do not apply to
projected impacts on soil carbon stocks from sea level rise, as the risk of soil carbon stock loss
associated with sea level rise is assessed in the AFOLU NPRT.
3.2.15 Buffer credits shall be deposited in the AFOLU pooled buffer account based upon the nonpermanence risk report assessed by the validation/verification body. Buffer credits cannot be
traded. The full rules and procedures with respect to the deposit of buffer credits are set out in
the Registration and Issuance Process.
3.2.16 Projects shall perform the non-permanence risk analysis at every verification event. Projects
that demonstrate their longevity, sustainability, and ability to mitigate risks through this
analysis may be eligible for release of buffer credits from the AFOLU pooled buffer account. The
full rules and procedures with respect to the release of buffer credits are set out in the
Registration and Issuance Process.
3.2.17 Validation of non-permanence risk analyses may be conducted by the same
validation/verification body that is conducting validation or verification of the project and at the
same time as the validation or verification of the project, as applicable. The rules and
requirements for the process of assessment by validation/verification body(s) are set out in
Section 4 below.
3.2.18 When an instance leaves a grouped project or non-grouped project with multiple activity
instances before the end of the project longevity, the following applies:
1) The project proponent shall conservatively assume a loss of all previously verified
reductions and removals associated with the instance; or
11

3 Project Requirements
2) The project proponent shall continue to monitor the instance for a minimum of the
remainder of the project longevity. Monitoring shall follow the requirements of the applied
methodology during the crediting period. Where it can be demonstrated that the applied
methodology monitoring requirements cannot be followed (e.g., due to loss of access to the
project area), a robust remote-sensing-based approach for the project types may be used to
detect loss events, upon Verra approval. Where the crediting period is less than the project
longevity, a remote-sensing-based approach may be used in the post-crediting period for
the remainder of the project longevity. Where a loss is identified, the size of the loss shall
be quantified according to the applied methodology or approved remote sensing approach.
Where this is not possible, the project shall conservatively assume a loss of all previously
verified reductions and removals associated with the instance.
3.2.19 When the project crediting period is greater than 40 years, the requirements under Section
3.2.18 shall apply until the end of the crediting period.
3.2.20 Where an event occurs that is likely to qualify as a loss event (see the VCS Program Definitions
for definition of loss event), the project proponent shall follow the loss event reporting
requirements set out in the Registration and Issuance Process.
3.2.21 At the verification event after the loss event, the monitoring report shall restate the loss from
the loss event and calculate the net GHG benefit for the monitoring period, including the loss
event, in accordance with the requirements set out in the methodology applied and the
Registration and Issuance Process.
3.2.22 At a verification event, where a reversal has occurred, the following applies:
1) Where the reversal is an unavoidable reversal (see the VCS Program Definitions for the
definition of unavoidable reversal), the project proponent shall follow the buffer account
reconciliation requirements set out in the Registration and Issuance Process, and the
following applies:
a) The baseline may be reassessed, including any relevant changes to baseline carbon
stocks and, where reassessed, shall be validated at the time of the verification event
after the reversal. Note that allowing baseline revisions after unavoidable reversals
supersedes any methodological requirements for a fixed baseline.
b) The same geographic boundary shall be maintained. The entire project area, including
areas degraded or disturbed by the unavoidable event, shall continue to be a part of
project monitoring. Projects may not seek GHG credits from any increased rate of
sequestration from natural regeneration after an unavoidable reversal until the loss
from unavoidable reversals is recovered.
2) Where the reversal is an avoidable reversal (see the VCS Program Definitions for the
definition of an avoidable reversal), the project proponent shall follow the buffer account
reconciliation requirements set out in the Registration and Issuance Process, and the
following applies:
12

3 Project Requirements
a) No further VCUs shall be issued to the project, or any other project with the same
project proponent or combination of project proponents, until the deficit is remedied.
The deficit is equivalent to the full amount of the reversal, including GHG emissions
from losses to project and baseline carbon stocks.
b) The same geographic boundary shall be maintained. The entire project area, including
areas degraded or disturbed by the avoidable event, shall continue to be a part of
project monitoring. Projects may not seek GHG credits from any increased rate of
sequestration from natural regeneration after a reversal until the loss from avoidable
reversals is recovered.
3.2.23 As set out in the Registration and Issuance Process, where projects fail to submit a verification
report the prescribed period from the previous verification event, a percentage of buffer credits
is put on hold under the conservative assumption that the carbon benefits represented by
buffer credits held in the AFOLU pooled buffer account may have been reversed or lost in the
field.
3.2.24 The permanence of carbon stocks shall be monitored for a minimum of 40 years. At its
discretion, Verra may agree to monitor a project or class of project types where the crediting
period is less than 40 years. Verra and the project proponent shall agree to the terms of such
monitoring in advance. Verra reserves the right to monitor a project for permanence without the
project proponent’s agreement if the project proponent terminates the project or its monitoring.
3.2.25 Where a project has a crediting period of less than 40 years and an avoidable reversal (see the
VCS Program Definitions for the definition of avoidable reversal) occurs within 40 years of the
project’s start date, projects shall compensate the AFOLU pooled buffer account according to
the procedures in the Registration and Issuance Process.
3.2.26 Each project proponent shall sign a written agreement with Verra to compensate the AFOLU
pooled buffer account for reversal events.
3.2.27 The remaining balance of buffer credits is canceled at the end of the project longevity or at the
end of monitoring, whichever is later.

Long-term Average GHG Benefit
3.2.28 Where ARR and IFM projects meet or exceed the harvesting activity definition, the long-term
average shall be applied. The stratification of the sample plots shall be proportionally
representative of areas with and without harvesting activity. Projects with harvesting activities
shall calculate the long-term average for the area of each stratum and cover the entire project
area.
3.2.29 ARR and IFM projects with harvesting activities shall not be issued GHG credits above the longterm average GHG benefit maintained by the project.
3.2.30 Where ARR or IFM projects include harvesting, the loss of carbon due to harvesting shall be
13

3 Project Requirements
included in the quantification of project emissions. The maximum number of GHG credits
available to projects shall not exceed the long-term average GHG benefit. The GHG benefit of a
project is the difference between the project scenario and the baseline scenario of carbon
stocks stored in the selected carbon pools and adjusted for any project emissions of N 2O, CH4
and fossil-derived CO2, and leakage emissions. The long-term average GHG benefit shall be
calculated using the following procedure:
1) Establish the period over which the long-term average GHG benefit shall be calculated,
noting the following:
a) For ARR or IFM projects undertaking even-aged management, the time period over
which the long-term GHG benefit is calculated shall include at minimum one full
harvest/cutting cycle, including the last harvest/cut in the cycle. For example, where
the total project crediting period is 40 years and has a harvest cycle of 12 years, the
long-term average GHG benefit will be determined for a period of 48 years.
b) For ARR projects under conservation easements with no intention to harvest after the
project crediting period, or for selectively-cut IFM projects, the time period over which
the long-term average is calculated shall be the length of the project crediting period.
2) Determine the expected total GHG benefit of the project for each year of the established
time period. For each year, the total GHG benefit is the to-date GHG emission reductions or
carbon dioxide removals from the project scenario minus baseline scenario.
3) Sum the total GHG benefit of each year over the established time period.
4) Calculate the average GHG benefit of the project over the established time period.
5) Use the following equation to calculate the long-term average GHG benefit:

𝐿𝐴 =

𝑛
𝑡=0 𝑃𝐸𝑡 − 𝐵𝐸𝑡

𝑛

Where:
LA

=

The long-term average GHG benefit

PEt

The total to-date GHG emission reductions and removals generated in the
project scenario (tCO 2e). Project scenario emission reductions and removals

The total to-date GHG emission reductions and removals projected for the
baseline scenario (tCO 2e)

t

=

Year

n

=

Total number of years in the established time period
14

3 Project Requirements
6) For ARR projects using a dynamic performance benchmark, the total with-project GHG
benefit will be used to set the long-term average because the change in the dynamic
crediting baseline is unknown and may not be accurately modelled at the time the longterm average is set. Note that the value of the change in stocking index ΔSI wp,t is monitored
up until the time at which the long-term average is reached, and then fixed for the
remainder of the crediting period. The following equation shall be used to calculate the
long-term average:

Where:
LA
=

The long-term average GHG benefit

PEt

=

The total GHG emissions reductions and removals generated in the project
scenario (tCO2e)

t

=

Year

n

=

Total number of years in the established time period

7) A project may seek GHG credits during each verification event until the long-term average
GHG benefit is reached. Once the total number of GHG credits issued has reached this
average, the project can no longer issue further GHG credits. The long-term average GHG
benefit shall be calculated at each verification event, meaning the long-term average GHG
benefit may change over time based on monitored data. For an example of determining the
long-term average GHG benefit, see the Verra website.
Buffer credits are withheld only when GHG credits are issued. The number of buffer credits
to withhold is based on the change in carbon stocks only (not the net GHG benefit), as such
the buffer credits will be based on the long-term average change in carbon stock. Use the
following equation to calculate the long-term average change in carbon stock.

Note – The VCS Program guidance document AFOLU Guidance: Example for Calculating the

website, provides examples for calculating the long-term average carbon stock for a variety of
ARR project scenarios with harvesting. The same examples can be applied to IFM projects with
harvesting.

3.3

ODS-Specific Matters

Concept
ODS projects may encounter unique circumstances related to project implementation, avoidance of
perverse incentives and other matters. This section sets out high-level requirements related to such
ODS-specific matters. Note that additional ODS-specific requirements are also set out throughout this
document.

Requirements
Eligible ODS
3.3.1

ODS residing in stockpiles or ODS recovered directly from any of the products set out in Section
3.3.2 are eligible. The following ODS controlled by the Montreal Protocol for which the IPCC
publishes a global warming potential (100-year time horizon) are eligible:
1) Annex A, Group I
2) Annex B, Group I
3) Annex C, Group I

3.3.2

The destruction of ODS recovered from the following products are eligible:
1) Refrigeration equipment, systems, or appliances;
2) Air conditioning equipment, systems, or appliances;
3) Fire suppression equipment or systems; and
4) Thermal insulation foams.

3.3.3

The destruction of ODS recovered from pre-polymers, aerosol products or other products is not
eligible.

ODS Origin
3.3.4

Where ODS is recovered from products that have been imported specifically for their
disassembly (i.e., the products have not been collected in the host country), the following shall
apply:

16

3 Project Requirements
1) The products shall not originate from any country in which any law, statute or other
regulatory framework requires the recovery and destruction of the relevant ODS from such
products.
2) The project proponent shall provide documentary evidence, such as shipping manifests,
bills of lading and evidence of collection of the products in the originating country, to
demonstrate the origin of such products.
3.3.5

Documentary evidence shall be provided to verify the origin of all ODS destroyed by the project.
Evidence may include, inter alia, shipping manifests, bills of lading, other commercial
documentation, and addresses of households, commercial premises, and other evidence of
collection of the products. Such evidence shall be appropriate to the nature and scale of the
project.

Destruction Technology
3.3.6

The project shall use a destruction technology that meets the screening criteria for destruction
technologies set out in the UNEP April 2002 Report of the Technology and Economic
Assessment Panel (TEAP), Volume 3b, Report of the Task Force on Destruction Technologies5,
as may be updated from time to time. The report sets out, inter alia, requirements for
Destruction and Removal Efficiency (DRE).

3.3.7

For concentrated sources (e.g., refrigerants), projects shall use a destruction technology with a
minimum verified DRE of 99.99 percent.

3.3.8

For dilute sources (i.e., foams), projects shall use a destruction technology with a minimum
verified DRE of 95 percent. In addition, a minimum Recovery and Destruction Efficiency (RDE)
of 85 percent shall be achieved. RDE describes the proportion of blowing agent (ODS)
remaining in the foam immediately prior to decommissioning that is recovered in the overall
end-of-life management step, including ultimate destruction. For a full specification of RDE, see
the UNEP May 2005 Report of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel, Volume 3,
Report of the Task Force on Foam End-of-Life Issues.6

Note – The May 2005 TEAP report provides a theoretical model for calculating RDE and methodologies
will need to specify a practical approach for determining RDE, such as those provided in RAL GZ 728

3 Project Requirements

3.4

GCS-Specific Matters

Concept
Geologic carbon storage is an umbrella term that broadly refers to carbon capture and storage
activities, geologic carbon mineralization, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage in geologic
reservoirs. GCS projects may encounter unique circumstances related to project implementation,
monitoring and other matters. High-level requirements related to such GCS-specific matters are set out
in the GCS Requirements. Note that additional GCS-specific requirements are also set out throughout
this document.

Requirements
General
3.4.1

GCS projects shall follow the requirements set out in the GCS Requirements.

3.5

Project Documentation

Concept
To complete the project validation process, project proponents prepare a project description, which
describes the project’s GHG emission reduction or removal activities. To complete the project
verification process, project proponents prepare a monitoring report, which describes the data and
information related to the monitoring of GHG emission reductions or carbon dioxide removals.

Requirements
Project Description
3.5.1

The project proponent shall use the VCS Project Description Template, an approved combined
project description template available on the Verra website, or an approved GHG program
project description template where the project is registered under an approved GHG program,
as appropriate. The project proponent shall adhere to all instructional text within the template.

3.5.2

All information in project documents shall be presumed to be public. Commercially sensitive
information may be protected, as set out in the Registration and Issuance Process, where it
can be demonstrated, to Verra’s satisfaction, that such information is commercially sensitive.

3.5.3

The validation/verification body shall confirm that any information designated by the project
proponent as commercially sensitive meets the VCS Program definition of commercially
sensitive information.

3.5.4

The following information in project documents shall not be considered commercially sensitive
and shall be provided in public versions of the project documents:
1) Determination of the baseline scenario
18

3 Project Requirements
2) Demonstration of additionality
3) Quantification of the estimated and actual GHG emissions reductions and removals
4) Monitoring of GHG emissions reductions and removals
5) Calculation of the non-permanence risk score

Monitoring Report
3.5.5

The project proponent shall use the VCS Monitoring Report Template or an approved combined
monitoring report template available on the Verra website, as appropriate, and adhere to all
instructional text within the template.

3.5.6

The monitoring period shall be a distinct time period that does not overlap with previous
monitoring periods. Projects shall not be eligible for crediting of GHG emission reductions and
removals generated in previous monitoring periods.

3.5.7

Grouped projects, AFOLU projects, and other projects with a risk of a reversal or loss event
shall not have gaps between monitoring periods.

3.5.8

The monitoring report shall specify the number of GHG emission reductions or carbon dioxide
removals generated in each calendar year of the monitoring period.

3.5.9

The monitoring report shall be verified prior to submission to Verra.

3.6

Project Design

Concept
The VCS Program allows for different approaches to project design. Projects may be designed as a
single installation of an activity. Projects may also be designed to include more than one project
activity, such as an AFOLU project that includes REDD and ALM components. In addition, projects may
be designed to include more than one project activity instance, such as a clean cookstove project that
distributes cookstoves to a number of different communities. Finally, projects may be designed as
grouped projects, which are projects structured to allow the expansion of a project activity subsequent
to project validation.
Note – Project activity and project activity instance both have the specific meanings that are set out in
the VCS Program Definitions.

Requirements
Multiple Project Activities
3.6.1

Projects may include multiple project activities where the methodology applied to the project
allows more than one project activity and/or where projects apply more than one methodology.

19

3 Project Requirements
3.6.2

Where more than one methodology has been applied to a project with multiple project
activities, the following applies:
1) Each project activity shall be specified separately in the project description, referencing the
relevant methodology.
2) All criteria and procedures set out in the applied methodologies in relation to applicability
conditions, demonstration of additionality, determination of baseline scenario and GHG
emission reduction and removal quantification shall be applied separately to each project
activity, noting the following:
a) A single set of criteria and procedures for the demonstration of additionality may be
applied where the applied methodologies reference the same additionality tool and/or
procedures, and where separate demonstration of additionality for each project activity
is not practicable.
For example, separate demonstration of additionality may not be practicable in project
activities that are implemented at a single facility and therefore represent a single
investment. The onus is upon the project proponent to demonstrate to the
validation/verification body that separate demonstration of additionality is not
practicable, failing which separate demonstration of additionality shall be provided.
Where a methodology specifies requirements for demonstrating additionality in
addition to those specified in the referenced additionality tool and/or procedures, such
requirements shall be adhered to.
b) The criteria and procedures for identifying the baseline scenario may be combined
where the relevant methodologies or the referenced additionality tool and/or
procedures specify criteria and procedures for combining baseline scenarios.
3) The criteria and procedures relating to all other aspects of the methodologies may be
combined.
4) Where AFOLU projects are required to undertake non-permanence risk assessment and
buffer withholding determination, this shall be done separately for each project activity.
Note – Where a single methodology is applicable to more than one project activity and where
the methodology does not provide clear procedures for the application of more than one
project activity, the above requirements shall be adhered to.

3.6.3

AFOLU projects that include multiple project activities shall conform with the respective project
requirements of each included AFOLU category.
For example, projects that combine agroforestry or enrichment planting with community
forestry in a single project, where farmers integrate these activities within a single landscape,
shall follow an ARR methodology for planting activities and an IFM methodology for community
forestry activities (except where the activities have been combined in a single methodology).
20

3 Project Requirements
Similarly, projects that integrate avoided grassland and shrubland conversion and improved
grazing practices shall follow an ACoGS methodology for grassland or shrubland protection
activities and an ALM methodology for improved grazing practices (except where both activities
have been combined into a single methodology). Avoided conversion projects in landscapes
that contain both forest and non-forest shall follow a REDD methodology for forested lands and
an AcoGS methodology for non-forested lands. For each activity covered by a different
methodology, the geographic extent of the area to which the methodology is applied shall be
clearly delineated.

Multiple Project Activity Instances
3.6.4

Both grouped and non-grouped projects can have multiple project activity instances.

3.6.5

Inclusion of further project activity instances subsequent to initial validation of a non-grouped
project is not permitted (see Sections 3.6.10 – 3.6.17 for information on grouped projects).

3.6.6

The baseline determination and additionality demonstration for all project activity instances in
a project shall be combined (e.g., multiple wind turbines shall be assessed in combination
rather than individually).

3.6.7

Where a project includes multiple project activity instances from multiple project activities, the
project activity instances from each project activity shall be assessed in accordance with
Sections 3.6.1 – 3.6.3.

3.6.8

The project proponent shall include in a singular project all project activity instances within ten
kilometers of another instance of the same project activity and with the same project
proponent (i.e., instances of the same project activity may not be spread across more than one
project if they are within ten kilometers of each other).

Capacity Limits
3.6.9

Where a capacity limit applies to a project activity included in the project, no project activity
instance shall exceed such limit. Further, no single cluster of project activity instances shall
exceed the capacity limit, determined as follows:
1) Each project activity instance that exceeds one percent of the capacity limit shall be
identified.
2) Such instances shall be divided into clusters, whereby each cluster is comprised any
system of such instances such that each instance is within one kilometer of at least one
other instance in the cluster. Instances that are not within one kilometer of any other
instance shall not be assigned to clusters.
3) None of the clusters shall exceed the capacity limit and no further project activity instances
shall be added to the project that would cause any of the clusters to exceed the capacity
limit.

21

3 Project Requirements

Grouped Projects
Baseline Scenario and Additionality
3.6.10 Grouped projects shall specify one or more clearly defined geographic areas within which
project activity instances may be developed. Such geographic areas shall be specified using
geodetic polygons as set out in Section 3.11 below. Geographic areas with no initial project
activity instances shall not be included in the project unless it can be demonstrated that the
same (or at least as conservative) baseline scenario and rationale for the demonstration of
additionality is applicable to such an area as a geographic area that does include initial project
activity instances.
3.6.11 Determination of baseline scenario and demonstration of additionality are based upon the
initial project activity instances. The initial project activity instances are those that are included
in the project description at validation and shall include all project activity instances currently
implemented on the issue date of the project description. The initial project activity instances
may also include any instances of the project activity that have been planned and developed to
a sufficient level of detail to enable their assessment at validation.
3.6.12 As with non-grouped projects, grouped projects may incorporate multiple project activities (see
Section 3.6.1 – 3.6.3 for more information on multiple project activities). Where a grouped
project includes multiple project activities, the project description shall designate which project
activities may occur in each geographic area.
3.6.13 The baseline scenario for a project activity shall be determined for each designated geographic
area, in accordance with the methodology applied to the project. Where a single baseline
scenario cannot be determined for a project activity over the entirety of a geographic area, the
geographic area shall be redefined or divided such that a single baseline scenario can be
determined for the revised geographic area or areas.
3.6.14 The additionality of the initial project activity instances shall be demonstrated for each
designated geographic area, in accordance with the methodology applied to the project. Where
the additionality of the initial project activity instances within a particular geographic area
cannot be demonstrated for the entirety of that geographic area, the geographic area shall be
redefined or divided such that the additionality of the instances occurring in the revised
geographic area or areas can be demonstrated.
3.6.15 Where factors relevant to the determination of the baseline scenario or demonstration of
additionality require assessment across a given area, the area shall be, at a minimum, the
grouped project geographic area. Examples of such factors include, inter alia, common
practice; laws, statutes, regulatory frameworks, or policies relevant to demonstration of
regulatory surplus; determination of regional grid emission factors; and historical deforestation
and degradation rates.

22

3 Project Requirements
New Project Activity Instance Eligibility Criteria
3.6.16 Grouped projects shall include one or more sets of eligibility criteria for the inclusion of new
project activity instances. At least one set of eligibility criteria for the inclusion of new project
activity instances shall be provided for each combination of project activity and geographic
area specified in the project description. Where grouped projects include multiple baseline
scenarios or demonstrations of additionality, such projects will require at least one set of
eligibility criteria for each combination of baseline scenario and demonstration of additionality
specified in the project description. A set of eligibility criteria shall ensure that new project
activity instances:
1) Meet the applicability conditions set out in the methodology applied to the project.
2) Use the technologies or measures specified in the project description.
3) Apply the technologies or measures in the same manner as specified in the project
description.
4) Are subject to the baseline scenario determined in the project description for the specified
project activity and geographic area.
5) Have characteristics with respect to additionality that are consistent with the initial
instances for the specified project activity and geographic area. For example, the new
project activity instances have financial, technical and/or other parameters (such as the
size/scale of the instances) consistent with the initial instances, or face the same
investment, technological and/or other barriers as the initial instances.
Inclusion of New Project Activity Instances
3.6.17 Grouped projects provide for the inclusion of new project activity instances subsequent to the
initial validation of the project. New project activity instances shall:
1) Occur within one of the designated geographic areas specified in the project description.
2) Conform with at least one complete set of eligibility criteria for the inclusion of new project
activity instances. Partial conformance with multiple sets of eligibility criteria is insufficient.
3) Be included in the monitoring report with sufficient technical, financial, geographic, and
other relevant information to demonstrate conformance with the applicable set of eligibility
criteria and enable evidence gathering by the validation/verification body.
4) Have evidence of project ownership, in respect of each project activity instance, held by the
project proponent from the respective start date of each project activity instance (i.e., the
date upon which the project activity instance began reducing or removing GHG emissions).
5) Have a start date that is the same as or later than the grouped project start date.

23

3 Project Requirements
6) Only be eligible for crediting from the later of start date of the project activity instance or
the start of the verification period in which they were added to the grouped project, through
to the end of the total project crediting period.
7) Not be or have been enrolled in another VCS project.
8) Adhere to the clustering and capacity limit requirements for multiple project activity
instances set out in 3.6.8 – 3.6.9.
3.6.18 Where inclusion of a new project activity instance necessitates the addition of a new project
proponent to the project, such instances shall be included in the grouped project description
within two years of the project activity instance start date or, where the project activity is an
AFOLU activity, within five years of the project activity instance start date. The procedure for
adding new project proponents is set out in the Registration and Issuance Process.
AFOLU Projects
3.6.19 AFOLU non-permanence risk analyses, where required, shall be assessed for the project area
specified in the project description (for requirements related to geographic areas of grouped
projects, see Section 3.11.1). Where risks are only relevant to a portion of the project area, the
project proponent shall:
1) Use the most conservative values (i.e., the highest risk score) applicable to the project
area; or
2) Divide the project area into sub-areas with similar risks, such that a single total risk rating
can be determined for each sub-area. Justification for the method of division shall be
provided. The project’s monitoring and verification reports shall list the total risk rating for
each sub-area and the corresponding net change in the project’s carbon stocks in the
same area. The risk rating for each sub-area applies only to the net change in the project’s
carbon stocks generated by the sub-area within the project area.
3.6.20 Activity-shifting, market leakage and ecological leakage assessments, where required, shall be
undertaken as set out in Section 3.15.6 – 3.15.16, and the methodology applied, on the initial
group of instances of each project activity and reassessed where new instances of the project
activity are included in the project.
3.6.21 No new instances may be added which overlap with any of the components of another AFOLU
project’s zone, set out in Section 3.11.3 – 3.11.5.
Project Description for Grouped Projects
3.6.22 A grouped project shall be described in a single project description, which shall contain the
following (in addition to the content required for non-grouped projects):

24

3 Project Requirements
1) A delineation of the geographic area(s) within which all project activity instances shall
occur. Such area(s) shall be specified by geodetic polygons as set out in Section 3.11
below.
2) One or more determinations of the baseline for the project activity in accordance with the
requirements of the methodology applied to the project.
3) One or more demonstrations of additionality for the project activity in accordance with the
requirements of the methodology applied to the project.
4) One or more sets of eligibility criteria for the inclusion of new project activity instances at
subsequent verification events.
5) A description of the central GHG information system and controls associated with the
project and its monitoring.
Note – Where the project includes more than one project activity, the above requirements shall
be addressed separately for each project activity, except for the delineation of geographic
areas and the description of the central GHG information system and controls, which shall be
addressed for the project as a whole.

3.7

Ownership

Concept
Project and jurisdictional proponents must demonstrate that they have the legal right to control and
operate project or program activities.

Requirements
3.7.1

The project description shall be accompanied by one or more of the following types of evidence
establishing project ownership accorded to the project proponent(s), or program ownership
accorded to the jurisdictional proponent(s), as the case may be (see the VCS Program
Definitions for definitions of project ownership and program ownership). To aid the readability
of this section, the term project ownership is used below, but should be substituted by the term
program ownership, as appropriate:
1) Project ownership arising or granted under statute, regulation, or decree by a competent
authority.
2) Project ownership arising under law.
3) Project ownership arising by virtue of a statutory, property or contractual right in the plant,
equipment or process that generates GHG emission reductions and/or removals (where the
project proponent has not been divested of such project ownership).

25

3 Project Requirements
4) Project ownership arising by virtue of a statutory, property or contractual right in the land,
vegetation or conservational or management process that generates GHG emission
reductions and/or removals (where the project proponent has not been divested of such
project ownership).
5) An enforceable and irrevocable agreement with the holder of the statutory, property or
contractual right in the plant, equipment or process that generates GHG emission
reductions and/or removals which vests project ownership in the project proponent.
6) An enforceable and irrevocable agreement with the holder of the statutory, property or
contractual right in the land, vegetation or conservational or management process that
generates GHG emission reductions or carbon dioxide removals which vests project
ownership in the project proponent.
7) Project ownership arising from the implementation7 or enforcement of laws, statutes or
regulatory frameworks that require activities be undertaken or incentivize activities that
generate GHG emission reductions or carbon dioxide removals.

3.8

Project Start Date

Concept
The project start date of a non-AFOLU project is the date on which the project began generating GHG
emission reductions or carbon dioxide removals. The project start date of an AFOLU project is the date
on which activities that lead to the generation of reductions or removals are implemented (e.g.,
preparing land for seeding, planting, changing agricultural or forestry practices, rewetting, restoring
hydrological functions, or implementing management or protection plans). Projects must complete
validation within specific timeframes from the project start date.

Requirements
Non-AFOLU Projects
3.8.1

Non-AFOLU projects shall complete validation within two years of the project start date.
Additional time is granted for non-AFOLU projects to complete validation where they are
applying a new VCS methodology. Specifically, projects using a new VCS methodology and
completing validation within two years of the approval of the methodology by Verra may
complete validation within four years of the project start date.

Note that new VCS methodology in this context refers to both newly issued VCS methodologies and
newly issued VCS revisions to approved GHG program methodologies. The grace period does not apply

7 Implemented in the context of this paragraph means enacted or introduced, consistent with use of the term under the

CDM rules on so-called Type E+ and Type E- policies.

26

3 Project Requirements
in relation to any subsequent versions of such new methodologies and new methodology revisions that
may be issued.

AFOLU Projects
3.8.2

AFOLU projects shall initiate the pipeline listing process (as set out in the Registration and
Issuance Process) within three years of the project start date.

3.8.3

All AFOLU projects with ex-ante emission reduction/removal estimates of 20,000 tCO2e per
year or less, and ARR, RWE and IFM (with the exclusion of Logged to Protected Forest (LtPF))
projects of any size shall complete validation within eight years of the project start date.

3.8.4

All other AFOLU projects shall complete validation within five years of the project start date.

ODS Projects
3.8.5

ODS projects shall conform with at least one of the following in relation to project start date:
1) The project start date shall not be before the Montreal Protocol production phase-out
deadline (except for critical/essential uses) for the relevant ODS as it applies to the host
country and/or any country from which ODS destroyed by the project is imported (as
applicable); or
2) The project start date shall not be before the date the host country and/or any country from
which ODS destroyed by the project is imported (as applicable) implements the production
phase-out, or consumption phase-out where such country does not produce the relevant
ODS, of the relevant ODS (critical/essential uses exempted). Such phase-outs shall be
implemented in combination with an import ban on the relevant ODS (critical/essential
uses exempted). This project start date requirement accounts for countries that phase-out
the relevant ODS in advance of their Montreal Protocol production phase-out deadline.
Note – The project can destroy ODS that has not been phased out under either of the two
options in above (e.g., if one ODS has contaminated another), but it shall receive no credit for
the destruction of such ODS. Note also that the relevant production phase-out deadlines are
those of the individual substances and not the substance groups.

3.8.6

Where the project imports ODS, it shall provide documentary evidence, such as shipping
manifests and bills of lading, to demonstrate that the ODS originates from a country meeting
with the above.

Standardized Methods
3.8.7

Notwithstanding the requirements set out in Sections 3.8.1 – 3.8.6 above, projects applying a
standardized method for determining additionality shall initiate the project pipeline listing
process set out in the Registration and Issuance Process within the project validation timelines
set out above. Validation may be completed at any time up to concurrent with the first
verification.

27

3 Project Requirements
For example, a non-AFOLU project applying a standardized method for determining additionality
shall initiate the project pipeline listing process within two years of the project start date and
may complete validation any time up to concurrent with the first verification.

Projects Registered with Other GHG Programs
3.8.8

For projects registered under an approved GHG program which are seeking registration with the
VCS Program, further specification with respect to the validation deadline is set out in Sections
3.23.9 through 3.23.13.

3.9

Project Crediting Period

Concept
The project crediting period is the time period for which GHG emission reductions or carbon dioxide
removals generated by the project are eligible for issuance as VCUs. Project crediting periods must be
renewed periodically to ensure that changes to a project’s baseline scenario and regulatory surplus are
taken into consideration throughout the project lifetime.

Requirements
Project Crediting Period Length
General
3.9.1

The total project crediting period shall be either seven years (twice renewable for a total of up
to 21 years) or ten years fixed, except for AFOLU and GCS projects as defined below and in the
GCS Requirements respectively.

AFOLU Projects
3.9.2

For ALM projects focusing exclusively on reducing N 2O, CH4 and/or fossil-derived CO2
emissions, the total project crediting period shall be either seven years (twice renewable for a
total of 21 years) or ten years fixed.

3.9.3

For all AFOLU projects other than such ALM projects described in 3.9.2, the initial project
crediting period shall be a minimum of 20 years up to a maximum of 100 years, which may be
renewed at most four times, with a total project crediting period not to exceed 100 years.

3.9.4

AFOLU projects shall have a credible and robust plan for managing and implementing the
project over the project crediting period.

3.9.5

For ARR or IFM extension of rotation age or low-productive to high-productive projects with
harvesting, the length of the project crediting period shall be set to include at least one
complete harvest/cutting cycle. In the case of selectively cut IFM projects, where trees are
individually selected for harvest, the harvest/cutting cycle is the allowable re-entry period into
the harvest area as determined by legal and regulatory requirements, and/or common practice.

28

3 Project Requirements
3.9.6

The earliest project crediting period start date for AFOLU projects shall be 1 January 2002.

Projects Registered under Other GHG Programs
3.9.7

Projects registered under other GHG programs are not eligible for VCU issuance beyond the end
of the total project crediting period under those programs. For example, a Clean Development
Mechanism (CDM) project with a seven year twice renewable project crediting period is not
eligible for VCU issuance beyond the end of those 21 years. Where projects have been
registered under more than one other GHG program, they are not eligible for VCU issuance after
the date that is the earliest end date of all applicable project crediting periods.
Note – Since the total project crediting period under the Joint Implementation (JI) program is
not defined ex-ante, the total project crediting period shall be deemed as 21 years for nonAFOLU JI projects and as 60 years for AFOLU JI projects 8.

Renewal of Project Crediting Period
3.9.8

The following applies with respect to the renewal of a project crediting period under the VCS
Program:
1) A full reassessment of additionality is not required when renewing the project crediting
period unless otherwise specified in the methodology. However, regulatory surplus shall be
demonstrated in accordance with the requirements set out in the VCS Program rules and
the project description shall be updated accordingly.
2) The validity of the original baseline scenario shall be demonstrated, or where invalid, a new
baseline scenario shall be determined when renewing the project crediting period as
follows:
a) The validity of the original baseline scenario shall be assessed. Such assessment shall
include an evaluation of the impact of new relevant national and/or sectoral policies
and circumstances on the validity of the baseline scenario.
b) Where it is determined that the original baseline scenario is still valid, the GHG
emissions associated with the original baseline scenario shall be reassessed using the
latest version of the CDM Tool to assess the validity of the original/current baseline
and to update the baseline at the renewal of a crediting period.
c) Where it is determined that the original baseline scenario is no longer valid, the current
baseline scenario shall be established in accordance with the VCS Program rules.
3) The project description, containing updated information with respect to the baseline, the
estimated reductions or removals and the monitoring plan, shall be submitted for
validation. Such updates shall be based upon the latest approved version of the
methodology or its replacement. Where the project does not meet the requirements of the

8 Consistent with the UNFCCC’s other project-based mechanism, CDM.

29

3 Project Requirements
latest approved version of the methodology or its replacement, the project proponent shall
select another applicable approved methodology (which may be a new methodology or
methodology revision it has had approved via the methodology development and review
process), or shall apply a methodology deviation (where a methodology deviation is
appropriate). Failing this, the project shall not be eligible for renewal of its project crediting
period.
4) The updated project description shall be validated in accordance with the VCS Program
rules. In addition, the project shall be validated against the (current) scope of the VCS
Program. Such validation report shall be issued after the end of the (previous) project
crediting period and within two years after the end of the (previous) project crediting period.
Additional time is granted for projects to complete such validation where they are switching
to a new VCS methodology (new VCS methodology in this context has the same meaning as
set out in Section 3.8.1) when renewing the project crediting period. Specifically, projects
switching to a new VCS methodology and completing such validation within one year of the
approval of the methodology by Verra may complete such validation within three years of
the end of the (previous) project crediting period.
Where a project crediting period is not renewed within these timelines the project crediting
period shall end and the project shall be ineligible for further crediting.

3.10 Project Scale
Concept
Projects are categorized by size according to their estimated average annual GHG emission reductions
or carbon dioxide removals. Materiality thresholds differ for projects of different sizes.

Requirements
3.10.1 Project size categorizations are as follows:
1) Projects: Less than or equal to 300,000 tonnes of CO 2e per year.
2) Large projects: Greater than 300,000 tonnes of CO 2e per year.
3.10.2 Materiality requirements for validation and verification differ according to project size, as set
out in Section 4.1.10 below.
3.10.3 Where applying a methodology with scale and/or capacity limits, it shall be demonstrated that
the project is not a fragmented part of a larger project or activity that would otherwise exceed
such limits. The project shall be considered a fragmented part of a larger project if within one
kilometer of the project boundary there exists another project where:
1) The project proponents for both projects are the same.
30

3 Project Requirements
2) The sectoral scope and project activity for both projects are the same.
3) The other project has been registered under the VCS Program or another GHG program
within the previous two years.

3.11 Project Location
Concept
The project location must be provided to accurately describe project characteristics and to demonstrate
a project’s conformance with other requirements, such as project ownership and regulatory
compliance.

Requirements
General
3.11.1 The project location shall be specified in the project description. Project location requirements
for AFOLU and GCS projects are specified below and in the GCS Requirements respectively. All
other projects shall provide:
1) The country, region/state/province, district, and community/municipality/city
2) For projects with a single project activity instance, a single geodetic coordinate
3) For projects with multiple project activity instances (see Sections 3.6.4 –3.6.22 ) and
grouped projects (see Section 3.6.10), either:
a) A geodetic coordinate for each instance, provided in a KML file; or
b) Geodetic polygon(s) provided in a KML file that:
i)

Encompass all instances in the project, and

ii) Delineate the smallest administrative division of land for the local government
(e.g., if the activity takes place within six villages, the six villages must each have
their own polygon).

AFOLU Projects
3.11.2 The spatial extent of the project shall be clearly specified to facilitate accurate monitoring,
reporting and verification of GHG emission reductions and carbon dioxide removals and to
demonstrate that the project meets the eligibility criteria of the relevant project category. The
description of the project location shall include the following information:
1) Name of the project area (e.g., compartment number, allotment number and local name).
2) Maps of the project zone.
31

3 Project Requirements
3) A KML file with geodetic polygons that precisely delineates the project zone of the AFOLU
project where reductions and removals occur, in accordance with the following:
a) Where the project zone is comprised of multiple polygons (parcels), the project location
details of each polygon/parcel shall be included in the project description.
b) Grouped projects and non-grouped projects with multiple project activity instances shall
provide geodetic polygons showing the boundary of each instance included in the
project. Non-contiguous project activity instances shall be reflected in the polygons in
the KML file.
c) KML files shall exclude at the project start:
i)

Any non-eligible areas (e.g., if a project activity relates to improved crop
management, the KML file should only be for the participating croplands and
should exclude any surrounding land that may be part of the property), and

ii)

Areas not part of the project area, as defined by the applied methodology (e.g.,
roads, water bodies, water ways, settlements).

4) Total size of the project zone.
5) Details of ownership.
3.11.3 The project area shall not overlap with the project area of another VCS AFOLU project.
3.11.4 The project proponent shall demonstrate control over the entire project area with documentary
evidence establishing project ownership, noting the following:
1) For non-grouped projects, the entire project area shall be under the control of the project
proponent at the time of validation or shall come to be under the control of the project
proponent by the first verification event.
2) Where the project proponent does not yet have control over the entire area at validation,
the entire project area (that shall be specified in accordance with Section 3.11.2) is to be
validated as if it were under control and the project is ready to be implemented.
3) Where less than 80 percent of the total proposed area of the project is under current
control at validation, the following applies:
a) It shall be demonstrated that the result of the additionality test is applicable to the
project area at the time of validation and to the entire project area to come under
control in the future.
b) The monitoring plan shall be designed such that it is flexible enough to deal with
changes in the size of the project.

32

3 Project Requirements
c) The project shall be verified within five years of validation. At verification, the size of the
project becomes fixed.
4) Where the area fixed at verification is smaller than intended at validation, areas that at
verification have not come under control of the project shall be considered in the leakage
management, mitigation, and accounting. This requires the selection, at validation, of a
methodology with appropriate leakage methods that may be used in the event the entire
area does not come under control of the project.
5) WRC projects located in a coastal zone shall consider the impact of expected sea level rise
on wetland migration (e.g., the potential for landward expansion of the wetland area) when
establishing the project area. Where it is not possible to include the entire area expected to
be impacted by landward expansion of the wetland area at validation, coastal WRC projects
may add land to the project area after the first verification to accommodate wetland
migration due to sea level rise, following the requirements for a project description
deviation as set out in Section 3.21. Where relevant, projects shall account for any changes
in carbon sequestration or GHG emission reductions resulting from lateral movement of
wetlands.
3.11.5 WRC projects shall demonstrate that:
1) There is no hydrological connectivity to adjacent (non-project) areas; or
2) It is not possible for hydrologically connected areas to have a negative impact on the
hydrology within the project area that could cause a significant increase in GHG emissions;
or
3) Where projects are hydrologically connected to adjacent areas that may have a negative
impact on the hydrology within the project area, projects shall demonstrate that such
impacts will not result in a significant increase in GHG emissions, as follows:
a) Peatland projects shall establish a WRC buffer zone to ensure that potential negative
impacts to the hydrology in the project area, such as causing the water table in the
project area to drop or otherwise negatively impacting the hydrology, are mitigated. The
WRC buffer zone may be inside or outside the geographic boundary of the project area.
Where it is outside of the project area, the WRC buffer zone shall be adjacent to the
project geographic boundary and binding water management agreements with land
holders in the WRC buffer zone shall be in place by the time of the first verification.
b) WRC buffer zones shall not overlap with another project’s area. The size and shape of
the WRC buffer zone shall be sufficient to avoid such negative impacts on the project
area, which may be demonstrated through peer reviewed literature or expert judgment.
c) All other wetland projects shall establish a WRC buffer zone as set out in Section
3.11.5(3)(a) above, or implement project activities or establish a mitigation plan to
ensure that impacts to the hydrology (e.g., interrupted water or sediment supply) do not
33

3 Project Requirements
result in a significant increase in GHG emissions. Emphasis shall be placed on
hydrological connectivity that is immediately adjacent to the project area.
d) Coastal wetlands shall consider hydrological connectivity originating from adjacent
lands and shall follow the applied methodology with respect to oceanic impacts.
e) Where a project activity to mitigate impacts from hydrological connectivity causes an
increase in GHG emissions in the project area or WRC buffer zone, such emissions
shall be included in GHG accounting where above de minimis.

3.12 Project Boundary
Concept
The project boundary includes the GHG sources, sinks, and reservoirs that are relevant to the project
and baseline scenarios. The relevant GHG sources, sinks, and reservoirs that must be included or
excluded, or are optional, are set out in the methodology(s) applied by the project.

Requirements
3.12.1 The project boundary shall be described (using diagrams, as required) and GHG sources, sinks,
and reservoirs shall be identified and assessed in accordance with the methodology applied to
the project. The project shall justify not selecting any relevant GHG source, sink, and reservoir.

3.13 Baseline Scenario
Concept
The baseline scenario represents the activities and GHG emissions that would occur in the absence of
the project activity. The baseline scenario must be accurately determined so that an accurate
comparison can be made between the GHG emissions that would have occurred under the baseline
scenario and the GHG emission reductions and/or removals that were achieved by project activities.

Requirements
3.13.1 The baseline scenario for the project shall be determined in accordance with the requirements
set out in the methodology applied to the project, and the choice of baseline scenario shall be
justified.
3.13.2 Equivalence in type and level of activity of products or services provided by the project and the
baseline scenario shall be demonstrated and, where appropriate, any significant differences
between the project and the baseline scenario shall be explained.
3.13.3 In developing the baseline scenario, assumptions, values, and procedures shall be selected
that help ensure that GHG emission reductions and carbon dioxide removals are not
overestimated.
34

3 Project Requirements
3.13.4 Government policies and legal requirements relevant to the project activity, such as minimum
product efficiency standards, air quality requirements, carbon taxes, and subsidies, shall be
taken into account when determining the baseline scenario.

3.14 Additionality
Concept
A project activity is additional if it can be demonstrated that the activity results in reductions or
removals that are in excess of what would be achieved under a “business as usual” scenario and the
activity would not have occurred in the absence of the incentive provided by carbon markets.
Additionality is an important characteristic of GHG credits, including VCUs, because it indicates that
they represent a net environmental benefit and a real reduction of GHG emissions, and can thus be
used to offset emissions.

Requirements
3.14.1 The project shall demonstrate regulatory surplus at validation and each project crediting period
renewal. Regulatory surplus means that project activities shall not be mandated by any law,
statute, or other regulatory framework, or for UNFCCC non-Annex I countries, any systematically
enforced law, statute, or other regulatory framework.
3.14.2 Additionality shall be demonstrated and assessed in accordance with the requirements set out
in the methodology applied to the project, noting the following exceptions:
1) Where a VCS module using an activity method (see the VCS Methodology Requirements for
further information on activity methods) is applicable to the project, additionality may be
demonstrated using the module in substitution of the additionality requirements set out in
the methodology.
For example, if a module uses an activity method (i.e., positive list) to deem a project
activity additional, the project proponent does not have to follow the additionality
requirements in the methodology applied to the project and may instead demonstrate
additionality by demonstrating that it meets the applicability conditions and any other
criteria of the activity method.
Note that only modules may be used in this way. Where a methodology contains an activity
method for additionality, the additionality procedures may not be applied in conjunction
with a different methodology.
2) Where the applied methodology was developed under an approved GHG program and uses
an activity method or other simplified procedure for demonstrating additionality, the project
proponent shall demonstrate to the validation/verification body that the simplified
procedure is appropriate to apply to the project considering the project characteristics,
including the context in which the project activity takes place. Failing this demonstration,
35

3 Project Requirements
the project proponent shall not use the simplified procedure for demonstrating additionality
and shall instead use an appropriate additionality assessment method in substitution.
For example, where a project is developed in the United States and applies a CDM
methodology which uses a simplified procedure for demonstrating additionality, the project
proponent shall demonstrate to the validation/verification body that the simplified
procedure is appropriate to apply given that the simplified procedure was originally
developed for application in a developing country context.

ODS Projects
3.14.3 The project shall not be mandated by any law, statute or other regulatory framework applying in
the host country that was implemented on or before 11 November 2001, or the compliance
rate of any such law, statute, or other regulatory framework during (part of) the project crediting
period shall be below 50 percent.

3.15 Quantification of GHG Emission Reductions and Carbon Dioxide
Removals
Concept
GHG emission reductions and carbon dioxide removals achieved by projects are the basis for the
volume of VCUs that can be issued. Reductions and removals must be quantified in accordance with
the applied methodology(s).

Requirements
3.15.1 GHG emissions, carbon stock changes, or carbon stocks shall be estimated for each GHG
source, sink, and reservoir relevant for the project (including leakage) and the baseline
scenarios.
3.15.2 The GHG emission reductions and carbon dioxide removals generated by the project shall be
quantified. Where both reductions and removals are generated, they shall be quantified and
reported separately where the applied methodology provides procedures and equations to do
so.
3.15.3 Metric tonnes shall be used as the unit of measure and the quantity of each type of GHG shall
be converted to tonnes of CO2 equivalent (CO2e).
3.15.4 All reductions and removals shall be converted to CO 2e using 100-year global warming
potential (GWP) values.
For reductions and removals occurring on or after 1 January 2021, all ex-ante estimates and
ex-post calculations shall be converted to CO 2e using GWP values from the IPCC Fifth

36

3 Project Requirements
Assessment Report (AR5).9 See Table 2 for the GWP values for methane and nitrous oxide
established in AR5.10
For reductions and removals occurring on or before 31 December 2020, all ex-ante estimates
and ex-post calculations may be converted to CO 2e using either the GWP values from the IPCC
Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) or those from AR5.
Projects that complete validation on or before 31 July 2021 may use GWP values from AR4 for
ex-ante emission reduction estimates, though such projects shall use GWP values from AR5 for
ex-post calculations.

3.15.5 At validation, the project proponent shall use the most recent version of a data source available
to establish default values, data, or parameters. At verification, the project proponent shall use
the most recent version of a data source available for data or parameters that are monitored.

AFOLU Projects
3.15.6 The potential for leakage shall be identified for AFOLU projects, and projects are encouraged to
include leakage management zones as part of the overall project design. Leakage
management zones can minimize the displacement of land use activities to areas outside the
project area by maintaining the production of goods and services, such as agricultural
products, within areas under the control of the project proponent or by addressing the socioeconomic factors that drive land use change. Activities to mitigate ecological leakage (i.e.,
where a project activity causes changes in GHG emissions or fluxes of GHG emissions from
ecosystems that are hydrologically connected to the project area) in WRC projects may include
the establishment of a leakage management zone inside the project boundary.
3.15.7 Activities to mitigate leakage and sustainably reduce deforestation and/or forest or wetland
degradation are encouraged and may include the establishment of agricultural intensification
practices on non-wetlands, lengthened fallow periods, agroforestry and fast-growing woodlots

3 Project Requirements
on degraded land, forest under-story farming, ecotourism and other sustainable livelihood
activities, sustainable production of non-timber forest products, and/or sustainable
aquaculture. Leakage mitigation activities may be supplemented by providing economic
opportunities for local communities that encourage forest or wetland protection, such as
employment as protected-area guards, training in sustainable forest use or assisting
communities in securing markets for sustainable forest products, such as rattan, vanilla,
cacao, coffee and natural medicines, or wetland products, such as rattan, fish, and shellfish.
3.15.8 Where projects are required to account for leakage, such leakage evaluation shall be
documented in the appropriate section of the project description and/or monitoring report, as
applicable.
3.15.9 Market leakage assessments shall occur in accordance with the requirements set out in the
applied methodology(s) at validation and verification.
3.15.10 Notwithstanding the requirement set out in Section 3.15.9 above, IFM projects may apply the
appropriate market leakage discount factor identified in Table 3 to the net change in carbon
stock associated with the activity that reduces timber harvest to determine market leakage.

•Where the ratio of merchantable biomass to total
biomass is lower within the area to which harvesting
is displaced compared to the project area, 70%
•Where the leakage is out of country, 0%

38

3 Project Requirements
3.15.11 Leakage occurring outside the host country (international leakage) does not need to be
quantified.
3.15.12 Projects shall not account for positive leakage (i.e., where GHG emissions decrease, or
removals increase, outside the project area due to project activities).
3.15.13 Where the applied methodology(s) does not set out a method to determine whether leakage is
de minimis, projects may use the process set out in the VCS Methodology Requirements or the
CDM A/R methodological Tool for testing significance of GHG Emissions in A/R CDM Project
Activities.
3.15.14 Projects may apply optional default leakage deductions at validation under the following
circumstances:
1) Where the applied methodology requires the quantification of activity-shifting leakage,
projects may apply the optional default activity-shifting leakage deduction of 15 percent to
the gross GHG emission reductions and/or removals.
2) Where the applied methodology requires the quantification of market leakage and where a)
timber is a significant11 commodity that is driving deforestation and/or degradation in the
baseline scenario and b) the project country is not a leading producer or exporter of forest
products as defined by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)12,
projects may apply the optional default market leakage deduction of 10 percent to the
gross GHG emission reductions and/or removals.
3.15.15 Projects shall monitor and calculate leakage, in accordance with the applied methodology, for
all ex-post accounting (i.e., at each verification), and leakage shall be deducted from the GHG
emission reductions and/or carbon dioxide removals of the project. Any leakage shall be
subtracted from the number of reductions and removals eligible to be issued as VCUs.
3.15.16 The number of GHG credits issued to projects is determined by subtracting out the buffer
credits from the GHG emission reductions or carbon dioxide removals (including leakage)
associated with the project. The buffer credits are calculated by multiplying the nonpermanence risk rating (as determined by the AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk Tool) times the
change in carbon stocks only. The full rules and procedures with respect to assignment of
buffer credits are set out in the Registration and Issuance Process.

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the host country’s SDG objectives where relevant and
feasible.
3.17.1 The project proponent shall demonstrate how the project activities, or additional activities
implemented by the project proponent, contribute to sustainable development, as defined by,
and tracked against the SDGs. The project proponent shall demonstrate that a project
contributes to at least three SDGs by the end of the first monitoring period, and in each
subsequent monitoring period. Where possible, project proponents should demonstrate how
the project activity(s) is consistent with the SDG objectives of the host country.
3.17.2 Projects that complete a verification to the Climate, Community & Biodiversity (CCB) Program or
40

3 Project Requirements

a VCS Program verification and report contributions to at least three SDGs in the CCB or SD
VISta project documentation do not need to conduct a separate demonstration of conformance
with the requirements set out in Section 3.17.1.

3.18 Stakeholder Engagement
Concept
Project proponents must engage with stakeholders during project design and implementation.

Requirements
Stakeholder Engagement and Consultation
3.18.1 The project proponent shall conduct a thorough assessment of the stakeholders 13 that will be
impacted by the project activities. In identifying stakeholders, the project proponent must
consider the significance of user populations and how deeply affected they may be by the
project activities, such that distant or intermittent user groups who will be affected in very
limited ways by the project need not be defined as stakeholders. The project description shall
include information on stakeholders at the start of the project, including:
1) The process(es) used to identify stakeholders likely impacted by the project and a list of
such stakeholders;
2) Identification of any legal or customary tenure/access rights to territories and resources,
including collective and/or conflicting rights, held by stakeholders;
3) A description of the social, economic and cultural diversity within stakeholders and the
differences and interactions between the stakeholders;

rights holders, and areas outside the project area that are predicted to be impacted by the
project;

13 Where the term “stakeholders” is used in VCS Program documents, it may refer to a person, entity, or stakeholder

group.

41

3 Project Requirements
7) The location of territories and resources which stakeholders own or to which they have
customary access; and
8) Any barriers to stakeholder engagement such as literacy and location or connection to
electricity and how the project proponent will address such barriers.
3.18.2 The project proponent shall conduct a stakeholder consultation before implementation of
project activities. Such consultations shall be done in a manner that is inclusive, culturally
appropriate, and respectful of local knowledge, and shall include:
1) A representative from each stakeholder group.
2) A discussion of the project design and implementation, including agreement and consent
from stakeholder groups to participate in the consultation.
3) The risks, costs and benefits the project may bring to stakeholders.

3.18.3 The project proponent shall take due account of all input received during the stakeholder
consultation and through ongoing communications. The input from stakeholders may require
updates to project design which shall be reported as a project description deviation. Where the
project proponent does not update the project design, the project proponent shall justify why
updates are not appropriate. The project proponent shall demonstrate to the
validation/verification body what action it has taken in respect of the stakeholder consultation
as part of validation, and in respect of ongoing communications as part of each subsequent
verification.
3.18.4 The project proponent shall develop a grievance redress procedure to address disputes with
stakeholders that may arise during project planning and implementation, including with regard
to benefit sharing and all other safeguard and stakeholder engagement requirements
mentioned in Sections 3.18 and 3.19 respectively. The procedure shall include processes for
receiving, hearing, responding and attempting to resolve grievances within a reasonable time
period, taking into account culturally appropriate conflict resolution methods. The procedure
and documentation of disputes resolved through the procedure shall be made publicly
available. The procedure shall have three stages:

42

3 Project Requirements
1) The project proponent shall attempt to amicably resolve all grievances and provide a
written response in a manner that is culturally appropriate.
2) Any grievances that are not resolved by amicable negotiations shall be referred to
mediation by a neutral third party.
3) Any grievances that are not resolved through mediation shall be referred either to a)
arbitration, to the extent allowed by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction or b) competent
courts in the relevant jurisdiction, without prejudice to a party’s ability to submit the
grievance to a competent supranational adjudicatory body, if any.
3.18.5 The project proponent shall establish mechanisms for ongoing communication with
stakeholders to allow stakeholders to raise concerns about potential negative impacts during
project implementation. As part of ongoing consultation, the project proponent shall
communicate at least:

43

3 Project Requirements
3.18.8 The project may affect property rights only if free, prior, and informed consent14 is obtained
from those concerned, including IPs, LCs, and customary rights holders, and a transparent
agreement is reached that includes provisions for just and fair compensation. In the event
there are any ongoing or unresolved conflicts over property rights, usage, or resources, the
project shall undertake no activity that could exacerbate the conflict or influence the outcome
of an unresolved dispute. Prior to establishing such an agreement, the project proponent shall
disclose, at a minimum, the following information:
1) The nature, size, pace, reversibility, and scope of any proposed project or activity;
2) The reason(s) or purpose of the project and/or activity;
3) The duration of the project activities;
4) The locations that will be affected;

including potential risks and fair and equitable benefit sharing in a context that respects
the precautionary principle;
6) Personnel likely to be involved in the execution of the proposed project (including
Indigenous Peoples, private sector staff, research institutions, government employees and
others)

Public Comments
3.18.9 All projects are subject to a 30-day public comment period. The date on which the project is
listed on the project pipeline as under validation marks the beginning of the project’s 30-day
public comment period (see the Registration and Issuance Process for more information on the
VCS project pipeline).
3.18.10 Projects shall remain on the project pipeline as under validation for the entirety of their 30-day
public comment period.
3.18.11 Any comments shall be submitted through the project’s page on the Verra Registry.
Respondents shall provide their name, organization, country, and email address. At the end of
the public comment period, Verra provides all comments received to the project proponent and
the validation/verification body. Verra makes a summary of all comments received public on
the project’s page on the Verra Registry.
3.18.12 The project proponent shall take due account of all comments received during the

consultation, which means they will need to either update the project design or demonstrate
the insignificance or irrelevance of the comment. They shall demonstrate to the
validation/verification body what action it has taken.
3.18.13 The validation/verification body shall not finalize validation until the 30-day public comment
period has ended and it has evaluated the project proponent’s responses to any comments
received.
3.18.14 Stakeholders may submit comments outside of the 30-day public comment period (see the
Registration and Issuance Process for more information on comments received outside of the
30-day public comment period). The project proponent shall address any comments received
within one year of receipt from Verra. To demonstrate they’ve evaluated the comments, the
project proponent shall respond to the stakeholder and complete a project description
deviation if applicable, or justify why no action was needed in the project description or
monitoring report.
3.18.15 The validation/verification body shall assess the project proponent’s responses to all
comments received as part of the subsequent validation and/or verification.
3.18.16 Stakeholders may submit comments at any time to request project documents that are
missing from the Verra Registry. The Verra Registry will coordinate with the project proponent to
provide any such documents to the project record on the Verra Registry and notify the
stakeholder once the document is posted.

3.19 Safeguards
Concept
Project activities must not negatively impact the natural environment or communities. Project
proponents must identify and address any negative environmental and socio-economic impacts of
project activities.

Requirements
General

3.19.1 Project proponents shall identify any potential negative impacts of project activities and design
and implement measures to mitigate them.
3.19.2 For the requirements in Section 3.19.4–3.19.29, the project proponent shall assess the risk of
any negative environmental and socio-economic impacts as a result of project activities. Where
the assessment identifies any such risks, the project proponent shall disclose the risks, and
design and implement measures, commensurate with the identified risks, to mitigate them. Any
such impact and mitigation measures shall be reported in the applicable project document at

validation and each verification.
3.19.3 Additional certification standards may be applied to demonstrate social and environmental
benefits beyond GHG emission reductions or carbon dioxide removals (details about labeling
with additional certifications are set out in Section 3.24 below).
Risks to Stakeholders and the Environment
3.19.4 The project proponent shall identify likely natural and human-induced risks to stakeholders’
well-being expected during the project lifetime as a result of project activities and outline
measures needed and implemented to mitigate these risks.
3.19.5 The project proponent shall identify the risks for stakeholders to participate in the project,
including project design and consultation. Risks may include trade-offs with food security, land
loss, loss of yields, negative impacts on livelihoods, and climate change adaptation. The project
shall be designed and implemented to avoid trade-offs and mitigate the identified risks to local
stakeholders.
3.19.6 The management teams involved in the project shall have expertise in and prior experience
implementing similar carbon or land management projects, and community engagement at the

project proponent shall either demonstrate that they have partnered with other organizations
with the relevant experience or have a recruitment strategy to fill the identified gaps.
3.19.7 The project proponent shall identify any risks related to working conditions as a result of project
activities and shall design and implement mitigation measures to provide safe and healthy
working conditions for employees.
3.19.8 The project proponent shall identify any risks related to the safety of women and girls in the
local community due to project activities and shall design and implement mitigation measures
that protect and appropriately respond to harm to women and girls in the local community.
3.19.9 The project proponent shall identify any risks as a result of project activities to children, and
minority and marginalized groups in the local community, and shall design and implement
mitigation measures to protect children, and minority and marginalized groups against and
appropriately respond to harm in the local community.

Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People and ILO Convention 169 on Indigenous and
Tribal Peoples, in project design and implementation.
3.19.18 The project proponent shall preserve and protect cultural heritage consistent with IPs’, LCs’
and customary rights holders’ practices or UNESCO Cultural Heritage conventions in project
design and implementation.
Property Rights

holders’ property rights and where feasible, take measures to help secure rights.
3.19.20 The project shall not encroach on private, stakeholder, or government property or relocate
people off their lands without prior consent and appropriate compensation.
3.19.21 The project shall not lead to forced physical or economic displacement.
3.19.22 Where the project activity impacts property rights, usage, or resources, the project shall
include a benefit-sharing agreement between affected stakeholder groups and the project
proponent. Such an agreement shall be:

3.19.23 IPs, LCs, and customary rights holders shall have access to the benefit sharing agreement.
3.19.24 The project proponent shall provide, at minimum, evidence and/or a draft of the benefitsharing agreement to the validation/verification body at validation. The implemented benefitsharing agreement shall be provided to the validation/verification body at each verification.
Ecosystem Health
3.19.25 The project shall not have negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems. Projects shall
identify any risks to ecosystems due to project activities and implement measures to ensure no
negative impacts on ecosystems.
3.19.26 Proponents of projects in or adjacent to habitats for rare, threatened, or endangered species,
and areas needed for habitat connectivity, shall demonstrate that they will not adversely
impact such habitats.
3.19.27 For projects that include planting or introduction of species:
1) The project shall not introduce any invasive species or allow an invasive species to thrive
as part of project activities. Project proponents shall identify invasive species using, in
order of priority, local, regional, or global invasive species registries. In instances where no
local or regional registries exist, the project proponent may use a locally applicable
information source other than a registry and shall provide the source used in the project
documents.
2) The project shall not use any species in the project activities that threaten the existence of
endangered species.
3.19.28 Activities that drain or degrade the hydrological functions of ecosystems are not eligible under
the VCS Program.
3.19.29 Activities that convert an ecosystem shall only be implemented in degraded ecosystems (see
VCS Program Definitions for the definition of degraded ecosystem).
1) Evidence shall be provided in the project description that the ecosystem was degraded
before the project start date.
2) Where the ecosystem was degraded within 10 years of the project start date of any ARR,
ALM, WRC, or ACoGS activity, evidence shall be provided that the ecosystem was not
degraded due to the project activity (e.g., that the degradation occurred in the pre-project
land use due to natural disasters such as hurricanes or floods).
3) Such evidence is not required where the ecosystem was degraded at least 10 years prior to
the proposed project start date, or where the dominant land cover is an invasive species
48

3 Project Requirements
that is threatening ecosystem health as demonstrated using the Global Invasive Species
Database and supporting documents such as evidence from peer reviewed literature or
expert judgment.
4) Where the project activity restores degraded ecosystems through ARR or WRC activities,
evidence shall be provided that the project activity restores a native ecosystem type
represented in the same ecoregion as the project. Such demonstration shall use remote
sensing, aerial imagery, modeling, or other relevant literature.

3.20 Methodology Deviations
Concept
Projects are permitted to deviate from the procedures set out in methodologies in certain cases, such
as where alternative methods may be more efficient for project-specific circumstances, or where the
deviation will achieve the same level of accuracy or is more conservative than what is set out in the
methodology.

Requirements
3.20.1 Deviations from the applied methodology are permitted where they represent a deviation from
the criteria and procedures relating to monitoring or measurement set out in the methodology
(i.e., deviations are permitted where they relate to data and parameters available at validation,
data and parameters monitored, or the monitoring plan).
3.20.2 Methodology deviations shall not negatively impact the conservativeness of the quantification
of reductions or removals, except where they result in increased accuracy of such
quantification. Deviations relating to any other part of the methodology shall not be permitted.
3.20.3 Methodology deviations shall be permitted at validation or verification, and their consequences
shall be reported in the validation or verification report, as applicable, and all subsequent
verification reports. Methodology deviations are not considered to be precedent setting.

3.21 Project Description Deviations
Concept
Projects are permitted to deviate from the validated project description in certain cases in order to
accommodate changing circumstances post-validation. Such deviations must be described and
assessed by a validation/verification body during the next project verification.

Requirements
3.21.1 Deviations from the project description are permitted at verification, subject to the
requirements below.
49

3 Project Requirements
3.21.2 The procedures for documenting a project description deviation depend on whether the
deviation impacts the applicability of the methodology, additionality, or the appropriateness of
the baseline scenario. Interpretation of whether the deviation impacts any of these shall be
determined in accordance with the CDM Guidelines on assessment of different types of
changes from the project activity as described in the registered PDD, mutatis mutandis. The
procedures are as follows:
1) Where the deviation impacts the applicability of the methodology, additionality or the
appropriateness of the baseline scenario, the deviation shall be described and justified in a
revised version of the project description. This shall include a description of when the
deviation occurred, the reasons for the deviation and how the deviation impacts the
applicability of the methodology, additionality and/or the appropriateness of the baseline
scenario.
An example of such a deviation is a change in project capacity where a different baseline
scenario would be more plausible, the applied methodology would no longer be applicable,
or there would be a significant impact on the investment analysis used by the project to
demonstrate additionality. Other examples include changes to the project that might have
similar impacts such as the addition of new carbon pools or new types of project activities.
2) Where the deviation does not impact the applicability of the methodology, additionality or
the appropriateness of the baseline scenario, and the project remains in conformance with
the applied methodology, the deviation shall be described and justified in the monitoring
report. This shall include a description of when the changes occurred and the reasons for
the changes. The deviation shall also be described in all subsequent monitoring reports.
Examples of such deviations include changes in the procedures for measurement and
monitoring, or project design changes that do not have an impact on the applicability of the
methodology, additionality, or the appropriateness of the baseline scenario.
3) Project proponents may apply project description deviations for the purpose of switching to
a different methodology, where permitted. Where a project switches to a new methodology
or methodology version, the project description shall be updated accordingly.
4) A project may switch to a new version of the existing methodology and update its project
description accordingly at any point during the crediting or baseline period.
3.21.3 Projects cannot claim additional GHG emission reductions or carbon dioxide removals in a
previously verified monitoring period resulting from a project description deviation.
3.21.4 The deviation shall be assessed by a validation/verification body and the process, findings and
conclusions shall be reported in the verification report. The assessment shall determine
whether the deviation is appropriately described and justified, and whether the project remains
in conformance with the VCS Program rules. The deviation shall also be reported on in all

50

3 Project Requirements
subsequent verification reports. Where the project description is updated, the updates shall be
validated.
3.21.5 Project description deviations are not considered to be precedent-setting.
3.21.6 The validation/verification body assessing the project description deviation shall be accredited
for the validation, recognizing that assessment of project description deviations is a validation
activity, as further set out in the VCS Program Guide.

3.22 Methodology Grace Periods
Concept
A methodology grace period is the amount of time in which projects may apply a methodology, module
or tool that has been revised, newly excluded or becomes inactive. The grace period deadline
corresponds with the date the validation report (for registration and crediting period renewal) or
verification report (for baseline reassessment) is issued.

Requirements
3.22.1 Grace periods are only granted to projects completing validation that requested listing on the
Verra Registry when the prevailing methodology version becomes inactive, or a methodology is
excluded from the VCS Program.
3.22.2 Projects that have already been validated may continue to apply the version of the methodology
under which they were validated until the next validation, baseline reassessment or crediting
period renewal, unless otherwise specified in the revised methodology.
3.22.3 The grace periods for completing validation are set as follows:
1) Where a methodology is revised, project proponents may apply the prevailing methodology
version for up to six months from the approval of the new version, unless otherwise
specified on the Verra website.
2) Where a methodology of an approved GHG program is newly excluded from the VCS
Program and replaced by a VCS methodology, project proponents may use the previously
accepted methodology of the approved GHG program for up to six months from the
approval of the VCS methodology.
3) Where a previously approved methodology becomes inactive, project proponents may use
the methodology version up to six months from the date it becomes inactive unless
otherwise specified on the Verra website.
4) Verra reserves the right to set different grace periods.

51

3 Project Requirements

3.23 Double Counting and Participation under Other GHG Programs
Concept
To maintain environmental integrity, GHG emission reductions and carbon dioxide removals generated
by a project must not be double counted or double sold. Double counting includes double issuance,
double claiming, and double use. See VCS Program Definitions for the full definitions of these terms.
This section contains requirements to prevent double issuance. Project proponents and all Verra
Registry account holders commit to not double sell VCUs through acceptance of the Verra Registry Terms of Use (ToU).
Reductions and removals must not be double counted within or across GHG programs. Projects are not
eligible to seek registration under the VCS Program if they are registered and active under another GHG
program. The term GHG program covers carbon crediting programs, as defined further in the VCS
Program Definitions. Further requirements relating to potential overlap of projects with other policies,
programs, and mechanisms such as emission trading programs and the Paris Agreement, and
requirements relating to public statements to aid the avoidance of Scope 3 emissions double claiming
are set out in Section 3.24 below.

Requirements
No Double Issuance
3.23.1 Project proponents shall not seek credit for the same GHG emission reduction or carbon
dioxide removal under the VCS Program and another GHG program. Projects issuing GHG
credits from different time periods under the VCS Program and another GHG program shall also
conform with the rules and requirements in the Registration and Issuance Process.
3.23.2 Where project proponents have received or are seeking credit for reductions and removals from
a project activity under the VCS Program and another GHG program, the following information
about the other GHG program shall be provided to the validation/verification body and Verra:
1) Name and contact information of administrator,
2) Details of participation under the program,
3) Details of the vintage period(s), volume(s), serial number(s), and all other relevant
identification information for emissions reductions and removals included,
4) Evidence that the same reductions and removals seeking credit under the VCS Program
have not been and will not be counted, used, or credited under the GHG program, or
evidence confirming the cancellation and non-use of credits issued under the other GHG
program. Such evidence may include:
a) A signed letter from the program administrator stating that the same reductions or
52

3 Project Requirements
removals have not and will not be otherwise counted, used, or credited under the other
GHG program;
b) A signed letter from the program administrator confirming the cancellation and non-use
of GHG program credits for the same reductions or removals seeking credit under the
VCS Program; or
c) Links to the official public program registry or project page demonstrating non-issuance
or cancellation of credits.

Registration in Other GHG Programs
3.23.3 Projects registered under another GHG program shall only be eligible for registration under the
VCS Program after the date of project inactivity in the other GHG program.
3.23.4 Projects registered under other GHG programs are not eligible for VCU issuance beyond the end
of the total project crediting period under those programs (see Section 3.9.7 for further
information).
3.23.5 Projects registered under another GHG program, with activities included within the scope of the
VCS Program (see Section 2.1), shall only be eligible to complete a gap validation and/or
register under the VCS Program where the conditions set out in Appendix 2 are met.
3.23.6 A project registered under another GHG program is only eligible for VCU issuance for reductions
and removals that occur after the date of project inactivity in the other GHG program.
3.23.7 Projects shall not alter their design during the gap validation process.

AFOLU Projects
3.23.8 In addition to the above, AFOLU projects registered under another GHG program shall conform
with the following:
1) All and any (VCS) monitoring and verification reports shall state the total amount of credits
(GHG credits and, where applicable, buffer credits) issued under the other GHG program.
2) The project shall prepare a non-permanence risk report in accordance with the AFOLU NonPermanence Risk Tool, and a validation/verification body shall undertake a full validation
of same in accordance with the VCS Program rules. The non-permanence risk analysis shall
be based upon the project as a whole, though the buffer withholding shall only apply to
credits sought under the VCS Program.
3) Where temporary GHG credits (e.g., temporary certified emission reductions (tCERs) or
long-term certified emission reductions (lCERs)) have been issued to the project, VCUs may
only be issued to the project if the tCERs have expired, in accordance with the rules and
requirements set out in the Registration and Issuance Process.
4) Where a loss event or a reversal occurs, the project shall conform with the rules for
reporting a loss event and holding/canceling credits set out in Section 3.2.18 and the
53

3 Project Requirements
Registration and Issuance Process. Such reporting, holding, and canceling shall apply to
the proportion of credits (GHG credits and buffer credits) granted to date under the VCS
Program.
For example, if 50 percent of the total credits (GHG credits and, where applicable, buffer
credits) related to the project have been issued under the VCS Program and a loss event
results in a reversal of reductions or removals achieved, VCS buffer credits would be
cancelled to cover 50 percent of the reversal. An example calculation is available on the
Verra website.

Approved GHG Programs
3.23.9 For projects registered under the CDM:
1) The project start date shall adhere to the start date requirements in Section 3.8 above.
2) Multiple CPAs registered under the CDM that have the same project proponent, the same
project activity, and occur within 10 km of one another shall register under the VCS as a
single project. Such projects shall complete a full VCS Project Description Template. A
validation/verification body shall undertake a validation of the full project description.
3) Multiple CPAs registered under the CDM that have the same project proponent and project
activity, but do not occur within 10km of one another, may register under the VCS as a
single project. Such projects shall complete a full VCS Project Description Template. A
validation/verification body shall undertake a validation of the full project description.
4) Projects or single CPAs registered under the CDM that register under the VCS as a
standalone project shall complete the cover page and Sections 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6,
1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.13, 1.14, 1.15, 1.16, 1.17, 1.18, 1.19, 2.4, and 3.6 of the VCS
Project Description Template.15 A validation/verification body shall undertake a validation
of same, which shall be accompanied by a validation representation, to provide a gap
validation for the project’s conformance with the VCS Program rules.
5) A CPA shall not subdivide into smaller projects or combine subdivided CPAs into one VCS
project.
6) Where multiple CPAs are registering as one project, the start date of the project shall be
the earliest CPA start date.
3.23.10 Projects registered under the JI program shall complete a new VCS Project Description
Template (applying a methodology eligible under the VCS Program). A validation/verification
body shall undertake a full validation of same in accordance with the VCS Program rules. The

15 Section numbers are based on the VCS Project Description Template, v4.4

54

3 Project Requirements
validation report shall be accompanied by a validation representation.
3.23.11 Projects registered under the Climate Action Reserve shall complete the cover page and
Sections 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.14, 1.16, 1.17, 1.18, 1.19, 2.1,
2.2, 2.3, 2.4 and 3.6 of the VCS Project Description Template16. A validation/verification body
shall undertake a validation of same, which shall be accompanied by a validation
representation, to provide a gap validation for the project’s conformance with VCS Program
rules.
3.23.12 The approved GHG program validation (or verification, where the approved GHG program does
not have a validation step) or VCS validation shall be completed within the relevant validation
deadline as set out in Section 3.8. Validation (or verification) is deemed to have been
completed when the validation (or verification) report that is submitted to the relevant program
to request registration has been issued.

Other GHG Programs
3.23.13 Projects registered under a GHG program that is not an approved GHG program may register
with the VCS Program where a validation or verification report has been issued under such
program (by an entity approved under the program to issue such reports). For such projects,
the following applies:
1) The project start date shall be on or after 19 November 2007.
2) A new VCS Project Description Template shall be completed (using a methodology eligible
under the VCS Program) and a validation/verification body shall undertake a full validation
of same in accordance with the VCS Program rules. The validation report shall be
accompanied by a validation representation.
3) The validation or verification that is submitted to request registration under the other GHG
program shall be completed within the relevant validation deadline set out in Section 3.8.
Validation or verification is deemed to have been completed when the validation or
verification report that is submitted to the other GHG program to request registration has
been issued.

Projects Rejected by Other GHG Programs
3.23.14 Projects rejected by other GHG programs due to procedural or eligibility requirements may be
considered under the VCS Program, but the following conditions shall be met:
1) The project description (where the other GHG program has rejected the project before VCS
validation) or monitoring report (where the other GHG program has rejected the project
after VCS validation) shall clearly state all GHG programs to which the project has applied

16 Section numbers are based on the VCS Project Description Template, v4.4

55

3 Project Requirements
for registration and the reason(s) for rejection. Such information shall not be deemed as
commercially sensitive information.
2) The validation/verification body shall be provided with the rejection document(s), including
any additional explanations.
3) The project shall be validated against the VCS Program rules. For projects where the other
GHG program has rejected the project after VCS validation, this means a complete
revalidation of the project against the VCS Program rules.

3.24 Double Claiming, Other Forms of Credit, and Scope 3 Emissions
Concept
GHG emission reductions and removals issued as VCUs must not be double claimed (see VCS Program
Definitions for the definition of double claiming).
Where project activities are in a supply chain, steps must also be taken to avoid Scope 3 emissions
double-claiming.17
VCU labels demonstrate that a unit meets the requirements of other (non-VCS) standard or program,
such as requirements under the Article 6 of the Paris Agreement (Article 6) or international Parisrelated programs such as the International Civil Aviation Organization’s Carbon Offsetting and
Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

Requirements
Article 6 of the Paris Agreement and International Paris-Related Programs
3.24.1 VCUs used in the context of Paris Agreement Article 6 mechanisms and international Parisrelated programs such as CORSIA shall meet any and all relevant requirements established
under such mechanisms and programs. This includes any requirements relating to double
counting and corresponding adjustments. 18 Project proponents may apply to receive VCU labels
applicable to these uses on the Verra Registry. See Section 3.25 for more information about
VCU labeling.
3.24.2 VCUs used for voluntary carbon market purposes do not require Article 6 or other Paris-related
program VCU labels, though labeled VCUs may be used for voluntary market transactions if
desired. Note, this applies to all voluntary carbon market transactions globally, including within
or between UNFCCC Annex I countries (unless otherwise regulated by those countries).

No Double Claiming with Emissions Trading Programs or Binding Emission Limits

17 The project proponent shall not be responsible for preventing other companies within the supply chain from reporting the

reductions or removals represented by the VCUs in their Scope 3 emission statements.
18 Such requirements are relevant equally to UNFCCC Annex I and non-Annex I countries.

56

3 Project Requirements
3.24.3 Project proponents shall not seek credit for the same GHG emissions reduction and carbon
dioxide removal under the VCS Program and an emission trading program or binding emission
limit (see the VCS Program Definitions for definitions of emissions trading program and binding
emission limit).
3.24.4 Where reductions and removals or project activities are also included in an emissions trading
program or binding emission limit, evidence shall be provided that the reductions and removals
generated by the project activity have not and will not be otherwise counted, used, or credited
under the program or scheme. The following information about the program or scheme shall be
provided to the validation/verification body and Verra:
1) Name and contact information of the administrator,
2) Details of participation under the program or scheme,
3) Details of the vintage period(s), project activity, GHG emissions reduction and carbon
dioxide removal scope and quantification, and all other relevant identification information
for reductions and removals included,
4) Evidence that all reductions and removals generated by the project activity have not and
will not be otherwise counted, used, or credited under the program or scheme. Such
evidence may include:
a) A signed letter from the program administrator, designated national authority, or other
relevant regulatory authority explaining how the reductions and removals generated by
the project activity in no way overlap with the scope of activities seeking or receiving
credit under the program or scheme;
or
b) A signed letter from the program administrator, designated national authority, or other
relevant regulatory authority stating that any units, credits, certificates, or benefits
under the emissions trading program or binding emission limit which overlap in any way
with reductions and removals generated by the project activity have been cancelled
and not used under the program or scheme.

No Double Claiming with Other Forms of Environmental Credit
3.24.5 Project proponents shall not seek credit for GHG emissions reductions and carbon dioxide
removals under the VCS Program which are receiving or seeking GHG-related credit for the
same project activity and time period under a GHG-related environmental credit system (see
the VCS Program Definitions for definition of GHG-related environmental credit system).
3.24.6 Where the same project activity is seeking or receiving another form of GHG-related
environmental credit from different time periods, evidence shall be provided that the GHGrelated credit for the same GHG emission reduction or carbon dioxide removal has not and will
not be otherwise counted, used, or credited under the GHG-related environmental credit
57

3 Project Requirements
system. The following information about the GHG-related environmental credit system shall be
provided to the validation/verification body and Verra:
1) Name and contact information of the administrator,
2) Details of participation under the GHG-related environmental credit system,
3) Details of the vintage period(s), project activity scope, and all other relevant identification
information for GHG-related environmental credits related to the project or project activity,
4) Evidence that GHG-related credit for the same project activity has not and will not be
otherwise counted, used, or credited under the GHG-related environmental credit system.
Such evidence may include:
a) A signed letter from the GHG-related environmental credit system administrator,
explaining how the project activity in no way overlaps with the scope of activities
seeking or receiving GHG-related credit under the GHG-related environmental credit
system;
or
b) A signed letter from the GHG-related environmental credit system administrator, stating
that any GHG-related units, credits, certificates, or benefits issued or provided by the
GHG-related environmental credit system, which overlap in any way with the project
activity, have been cancelled and not used under the GHG-related environmental credit
system.
Note – The requirements set out in Section 3.24.6 apply to all forms of GHG-related credit that
could be interpreted as having GHG emissions reduction or removal or GHG-related value.
However, Section 3.24.6 does not apply to non-GHG-related environmental credits, such as
biodiversity or water credits.

Supply Chain (Scope 3) Emissions
3.24.7 Where the project proponent(s) or authorized representative is a buyer or seller of a product
(i.e., a good or service) that is in a supply chain and whose product emissions footprint is
changed by the project activities specified in the project description, 19 the project proponent(s)
or authorized representative shall make a statement on their website stating; “Carbon credits
may be issued through Verified Carbon Standard project [project ID] for the greenhouse gas
emission reductions or removals associated with [project proponent or authorized
representative organization name(s)] [name of product(s) whose emissions footprint is changed
by the project activities].” The public statement shall be issued by the validation date.

19For example, for a project activity that utilizes CO

2 in concrete production, the concrete’s emissions footprint is changed by

the project activities.

58

3 Project Requirements

3.25 VCU Labels
Concept
VCU labels designate that a particular VCU has met the requirements of another certification or is
eligible or approved for use in a national, sectoral, or investor-specific market. A VCU label does not
represent ownership of the benefits or outcomes generated by the project to fulfil the requirements of
any other standard or criteria. See the Registration and Issuance Process for details on label
application. The Verra website lists available VCU labels and the procedure for attaining such labels.

Requirements
3.25.1 Where a VCU vintage period is entirely within the time period for which the requirements of a
qualifying certification have been met, or the eligibility or approval is valid, VCUs from that
period may be labeled.
3.25.2 Where the period of a qualifying certification entirely encompasses the project lifetime or
monitoring period, the qualifying certification may be referred to as evidence for meeting
relevant requirements of the VCS Program in a project description or monitoring report
(respectively).20

3.26 Records and Information
Concept
The project proponent must make relevant information available to the validation/verification body
during validation and each verification and must retain documents and records related to the project
for future reference.

Requirements
Records Relating to the Project
3.26.1 The project proponent shall ensure that all documents and records are kept in a secure and
retrievable manner for at least two years after the end of the total project crediting period.

Information for the Validation/Verification Body
3.26.2 For validation, the project proponent shall make available to the validation/verification body
the project description, evidence of project ownership and any requested supporting
information and data needed to support statements and data in the project description and
evidence of project ownership.

20 Project proponents are not prohibited from transferring ownership of the benefits or outcomes generated by the project

to fulfil the requirements of another standard or program to the credit buyer. Any transfer of ownership falls outside the
scope of the VCS Program and therefore carries no assurances.

59

3 Project Requirements
3.26.3 For verification, the project proponent shall make available to the validation/verification body
the project description, validation report, monitoring report applicable to the monitoring period
and any requested supporting information and data needed to support statements and data in
the monitoring report.

60

4 Validation and Verification Requirements

4 VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION
REQUIREMENTS
This section sets out the rules and requirements for validation and verification of projects under the
VCS Program. Validation/verification bodies must assess projects’ conformance with the VCS Program
rules and the applied methodology. Validation/verification bodies must be approved under the VCS
Program as set out in the VCS Program Guide.

4.1

Introduction and General Requirements

Concept
Validation is the independent assessment of the project by a validation/verification body that
determines whether the project and its GHG statement conforms with the VCS Program rules and
evaluates the reasonableness of assumptions, limitations, and methods that support a claim about the
outcome of future activities. Verification is the periodic ex-post independent assessment by a
validation/verification body of the project and its GHG statement of emission reductions and carbon
dioxide removals that have occurred as a result of the project during the monitoring period. Verification
is based on historical data and information to determine whether the claim is materially correct,
conforms with specified requirements, and is conducted in accordance with the VCS Program rules.

Requirements
General
4.1.1

Validation and verification are risk-based processes and shall be carried out in conformance
with ISO 14064-3 and ISO 14065. Additional requirements with respect to validation and
verification are set out in this Section 4 and shall be adhered to.

4.1.2

The validation/verification body shall gather evidence to:
1) Validate a project to determine conformance with the VCS Program rules and evaluate the
reasonableness of assumptions, limitations, and methods that support a statement about
the outcome of future activities, and/or;
2) Verify a statement of historical data and information of a project to a reasonable level of
assurance and ensure that the project meets the relevant materiality requirements.

4.1.3

The project shall be validated, and GHG statements of reductions or removals verified, by a
validation/verification body that meets with the eligibility requirements set out in the VCS
Program Guide.

4.1.4

Validation and verification of the project may be undertaken by the same validation/verification
61

4 Validation and Verification Requirements
body, noting the rules on rotation of validation/verification bodies set out in Section 4.1.27
below. Validation may occur before the first verification or at the same time as the first
verification.
4.1.5

The validation/verification body shall ensure that the project is listed on the project pipeline
with a status of under validation before the opening meeting with the project proponent, such
opening meeting representing the beginning of the validation process. Further, validation shall
not begin until the 30-day public comment period has begun, and the validation/verification
body shall not complete validation until after the 30-day public comment period has ended.

4.1.6

The validation/verification body shall evaluate the project proponent’s response to comments
received during the 30-day public comment period.

4.1.7

Where a comment on a project has been submitted to Verra outside the 30-day public
comment period, in accordance with Section 3.18.15, , the validation/verification that
conducts the next validation and/or verification body shall evaluate the project proponent’s
response to such comment.

4.1.8

Where the project applies a methodology from an approved GHG program that does not have
an independent validation step the project shall be validated in accordance with the VCS
Program rules.

4.1.9

Validation/verification bodies are expected to follow the guidance provided in the VCS
Validation and Verification Manual when validating or verifying projects and conducting
methodology assessments under the VCS Program.

Validation and Verification Process
4.1.10 In addition to the requirements set out in ISO 14064-3, the following applies:
1) The level of assurance for verifications shall be reasonable, with respect to material errors,
omissions, and misrepresentations.
2) The criteria for validation shall be the VCS Version 4, or approved GHG program where the
validation is performed under an approved GHG program (as in cases of participation under
the VCS Program and an approved GHG program). The criteria for verification shall be the
VCS Version 4 (regardless of the VCS version or GHG program under which the project was
validated). This means the validation or verification shall ensure conformance of the project
with the VCS Program rules, or rules and requirements of the approved GHG program, as
applicable.
3) The objective of validation or verification shall be in conformance with the VCS Program
rules and the methodology applied to the project.
4) The threshold for materiality with respect to the aggregate of errors, omissions, and
misrepresentations relative to the total reported GHG emission reductions and/or removals
shall be five percent for projects and one percent for large projects.
62

4 Validation and Verification Requirements
4.1.11 A site visit that includes a visit to facilities and/or project areas shall be conducted at validation
and project crediting period renewal validation.
4.1.12 A site visit that includes a visit to facilities and/or project areas shall be conducted at
verification under the following circumstances:
1) The first verification of the project after validation;
2) Verifications that include project baseline reassessments; and
3) Verifications that assess a project description deviation where the deviation impacts the
applicability of the methodology, additionality or the appropriateness of the baseline
scenario.
4.1.13 Where a site visit to facilities and/or project areas is not required under Section 4.1.12 the
validation/verification body shall identify whether a site visit is needed based on an
independent risk assessment. Such risk assessment shall identify the risk of a material
misstatement or nonconformity with the audit criteria. Where it is determined that no site visit
is required, the validation/verification body shall justify and document the rationale for the
decision.
4.1.14 Where a site visit occurs prior to the end of the monitoring period, the validation/verification
body shall verify the volume of GHG emission reductions or carbon dioxide removals generated
between the site visit and the end of the monitoring period, and clearly describe the additional
evidence gathering activities conducted.
4.1.15 Evaluation of the project’s stakeholder engagement shall be done in a culturally appropriate
manner, and individual stakeholders and/or stakeholder groups to be interviewed shall be
selected by the validation/verification body’s auditor team independently and, to the extent
possible, in advance of the site visit. Validation/verification bodies shall plan and conduct
interviews in a manner that demonstrates that the stakeholder interviews are free from bias or
influence from the project proponent.
4.1.16 Where the project does not fully conform with the methodology, the validation/verification body
shall determine whether this represents a methodology deviation or a methodology revision (in
accordance with the specifications for each), and the case shall be handled accordingly.
4.1.17 Where the project applies a revision to an approved GHG program methodology and the version
of the (underlying) methodology referenced by the methodology revision is no longer current,
the validation/verification body shall determine whether material changes have occurred to the
underlying methodology that affect the integrity of the methodology revision. Where such
material changes have occurred, the project shall not be approved.
4.1.18 Where the project does not meet the criteria for validation or verification, the
validation/verification body shall produce a negative validation opinion and provide the
validation or verification report and project description, or monitoring report, to Verra. The
63

4 Validation and Verification Requirements
project shall be ineligible for registration until such time as corrective action is taken and the
same validation/verification body has provided a positive validation or verification.

Competence
4.1.19 The validation/verification body and validation and verification team shall meet the
competence requirements set out in ISO 14065.

Validation and Verification Reporting
4.1.20 The validation report describes the validation process, any findings raised during validation and
their resolution, and the opinion reached by the validation/verification body on the GHG
statement in the project description document and/or monitoring report. The
validation/verification body shall use the VCS Validation Report Template, an approved
combined validation report template available on the Verra website, or an approved GHG
program validation report template where the project is registered under an approved GHG
program, as appropriate, and adhere to all instructional text within the template. The validation
report shall be accompanied by a validation representation, which shall be prepared using the
VCS Validation Deed of Representation Template.
4.1.21 The verification report describes the verification process, any findings raised during verification
and their resolutions, and the opinion reached by the validation/verification body. The
validation/verification body shall use the VCS Verification Report Template, or an approved
combined verification report template available on the Verra website, and adhere to all
instructional text within the template. The verification report shall be accompanied by a
verification representation, which shall be prepared using the VCS Verification Deed of
Representation Template.
4.1.22 The verification report shall specify the number of GHG emission reductions or carbon dioxide
removals generated in each calendar year of the monitoring period.

Validation and Verification Opinion
4.1.23 The validation report and the verification report shall contain a validation opinion and a
verification opinion, respectively.
4.1.24 Validation and verification opinions shall:
1) State the date of the opinion.
2) State the name of project; the GHG statement subject to validation or verification, including
the date and period it covers, and that the GHG statement is the responsibility of the
project proponent(s).
3) Identify the objectives, scope and criteria used to compile and assess the GHG statement.
4) Describe whether the data and information supporting the GHG statement were
hypothetical, projected and/or historical in nature.
64

4 Validation and Verification Requirements
5) Include the validation/verification body’s conclusion on the GHG statement. Adverse,
disclaimed, modified, or qualified opinions shall include a description of the reason(s) for
the opinion, placed before the validation/verification body’s conclusion.
6) Describe the verification body’s conclusion including level of assurance.
7) For validation conclusions of the GHG statement of forecast of future emission
reductions/removals, the GHG opinion shall explain that actual results may differ from the
forecast as the estimate is based on assumptions that may change in the future.
8) International Accreditation Forum accreditation body approved validation/verification body
opinions shall include a declaration that the validation and/or verification of the GHG
statement was conducted in accordance with ISO 14064-3. The applicable ISO version
shall be included (e.g., ISO 14064-3; 2019).
9) For AFOLU projects, state the version number of the non-permanence risk tool or market
leakage evaluation documentation upon which the opinion is based.
4.1.25 Verification opinions shall state the volume of GHG emission reductions and carbon dioxide
removals generated during the monitoring period that have been verified. The verification
opinion shall contain separate statements for reductions and removals where these are
reported separately in accordance with the applied methodology . For AFOLU projects, the
verification opinion shall also include the non-permanence risk rating, leakage emissions, and
number of reductions and removals eligible to be issued as VCUs.

Records of Validation and Verification
4.1.26 The validation/verification body shall keep all documents and records in a secure and
retrievable manner for at least two years after the end of the total project crediting period, even
where they do not conduct verification for the whole project crediting period.

Rotation of Validation/Verification Bodies
4.1.27 Rotation of validation/verification bodies is required in respect of validation and verification, as
follows:
1) Initial validation and the first verification of a project may be undertaken by the same
validation/verification body. However, the subsequent verification shall be undertaken by a
different validation/verification body. For example, if validation and verification were
undertaken at the same time, the subsequent verification would have to be undertaken by
a different validation/verification body. If validation was undertaken first (i.e., separately),
the first verification could be undertaken by the same validation/verification body, but the
subsequent verification would have to be undertaken by a different validation/verification
body.
Note – The gap validation of a project registered under an approved GHG program may be
disregarded when assessing adherence to these requirements.
65

4 Validation and Verification Requirements
2) A validation/verification body shall not verify more than six consecutive years of a project’s
GHG emission reductions or carbon dioxide removals. The validation/verification body may
undertake further verification for the project only when at least three years of the project’s
reductions or removals have been verified by a different validation/verification body.
Notwithstanding these rules, where AFOLU projects have verification periods longer than six
years, a validation/verification body is permitted to verify more than six consecutive years
of a project’s reductions or removals, and the subsequent verification shall be undertaken
by a different validation/verification body.
3) Crediting period renewal validation and the first verification of the renewed crediting period
may be undertaken by the same validation/verification body if that validation/verification
body did not complete the final verification of the crediting period. However, the
subsequent verification shall be undertaken by a different validation/verification body.
4) Where the final verification of a crediting period and validation of the crediting period
renewal are undertaken by the same validation/verification body, the subsequent
verification shall be undertaken by a different validation/verification body.
Note – Validations and verifications performed under other GHG programs shall be counted
when assessing adherence to these requirements.

Validation and Verification Requirements for Grouped Projects
4.1.28 Validation and verification of grouped projects shall assess conformance of the project with the
requirements for grouped projects set out in the VCS Program rules.
4.1.29 New project activity instances shall be validated, based on the information reported in the
monitoring report, against the applicable set of eligibility criteria. The validation/verification
body shall specify which instances meet the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the project. Such
validation may be reported in the verification report or a separate validation report.
4.1.30 Where, due to the number of project activity instances, it is unreasonable to undertake an
individual assessment of each initial or new instance, the validation/verification body shall
document and explain the evidence gathering methods employed for the validation of such
instances. Such evidence gathering methods shall be statistically sound. The number of
instances included in the project, eligible for monitoring and generation of VCUs shall be
proportional to the percentage of sampled instances found to be in conformance by the
validation/verification body.
4.1.31 The verification report for grouped projects shall document and explain the evidence gathering
methods employed by the validation/verification body for the verification of the GHG statement
of reductions or removals generated by the project. Such methods shall be statistically sound.
Any subsequent changes to the evidence gathering method(s) required as a result of the
verification findings shall be documented.

66

4 Validation and Verification Requirements

Non-Permanence Risk Analysis and Market Leakage Evaluations for AFOLU Projects
4.1.32 Non-Permanence risk analysis and market leakage evaluations shall be assessed by the
validation/verification body in accordance with the VCS Program rules.
4.1.33 The validation/verification body shall assess the risk analysis carried out by the project
proponent in accordance with the AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk Tool and GCS NonPermanence Risk Tool. The project proponent shall respond to all and any of the
validation/verification body’s findings. As a result of any such findings, the project proponent
shall amend the documentation as necessary and update the risk rating accordingly.

67

Appendix 1 Eligible AFOLU Project Categories

APPENDIX 1 ELIGIBLE AFOLU PROJECT
CATEGORIES
This appendix defines the types of activities that are included within each AFOLU project category and
is intended to aid project proponents in determining which type of methodology may be applicable to
their AFOLU project activity(s). As set out in Section 3.2 above, AFOLU projects must apply a
methodology eligible under the VCS Program.
Additional information about the eligible activities and specific GHG sources, sinks and reservoirs that
must be included in methodologies developed under the VCS Program for each eligible AFOLU project
category is available in the VCS Methodology Requirements.

Afforestation, Reforestation and Revegetation (ARR)
A1.1

Eligible ARR activities are those that increase carbon sequestration and/or reduce GHG
emissions by establishing, increasing, or restoring vegetative cover (forest or non-forest)
through the planting, sowing, or human-assisted natural regeneration of woody vegetation.
Eligible ARR projects may include timber harvesting in their management plan.
Note – Tree planting activities on forest lands managed for wood products (i.e., with a forest
management plan) are categorized as IFM project activities.

Agricultural Land Management (ALM)
A1.2

Eligible ALM activities are those that reduce net GHG emissions on croplands and grasslands
by increasing carbon stocks in soils and woody biomass and/or decreasing CO 2, N2O and/or
CH4 emissions from soils. The project area shall not be cleared of native ecosystems within the
10-year period prior to the project start date. Eligible ALM activities include:
1) Improved Cropland Management (ICM): This category includes practices that demonstrably
reduce net GHG emissions of cropland systems by increasing soil carbon stocks, reducing
soil N2O emissions, and/or reducing CH 4 emissions.
2) Improved Grassland Management (IGM): This category includes practices that
demonstrably reduce net GHG emissions of grassland ecosystems by increasing soil carbon
stocks, reducing N 2O emissions and/or reducing CH 4 emissions.
3) Cropland and Grassland Land-use Conversions (CGLC): This category includes practices
that convert cropland to grassland or grassland to cropland and reduce net GHG emissions
by increasing carbon stocks, reducing N 2O emissions, and/or reducing CH 4 emissions.
Note – Project activities relating to manure management are eligible under sectoral scope 15
68

Appendix 1 Eligible AFOLU Project Categories

(livestock, enteric fermentation, and manure management), not sectoral scope 14 (AFOLU).

Improved Forest Management (IFM)
A1.3

Eligible IFM activities are those that increase carbon sequestration and/or reduce GHG
emissions on forest lands managed for wood products such as sawtimber, pulpwood and
fuelwood by increasing biomass carbon stocks through improving forest management
practices. The baseline and project scenarios for the project area shall qualify as forests
remaining as forests, such as set out in the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for
National GHG Inventories, and the project area shall be designated, sanctioned or approved for
wood product management by a national or local regulatory body (e.g., as logging concessions
or plantations).

A1.4

Various sanctioned forest management activities may be changed to increase carbon stocks
and/or reduce emissions, but only a subset of these activities make a measurable difference to
the long-term increase in net GHG emissions compared to the baseline scenario. Eligible IFM
activities include:
1) Reduced Impact Logging (RIL): This category includes practices that reduce net GHG
emissions by switching from conventional logging to RIL during timber harvesting.
2) Logged to Protected Forest (LtPF): This category includes practices that reduce net GHG
emissions by permanently converting logged forests to protected forests. By eliminating
harvesting for timber, biomass carbon stocks are protected and can increase as the forest
re-grows and/or continues to grow. Harvesting of trees to advance conservation purposes
(e.g., the removal of diseased trees) may continue in the project scenario.
3) Extended Rotation Age / Cutting Cycle (ERA): This category includes practices that reduce
net GHG emissions of evenly aged managed forests by extending the rotation age or cutting
cycle and increasing carbon stocks.
4) Low-Productive to High-Productive Forest (LtHP): This category includes practices that
increase carbon sequestration by converting low-productivity forests to high-productivity
forests. Note - Activities that reduce GHG emissions from unsanctioned forest degradation
(e.g., illegal logging) are considered REDD activities. Activities that degrade wetlands to
increase forest production are not eligible.

Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD)
A1.5

Eligible REDD activities are those that reduce net GHG emissions by reducing deforestation
and/or degradation of forests. Deforestation is the direct, human-induced conversion of forest
land to non-forest land. Degradation is the persistent reduction of canopy cover and/or carbon
stocks in a forest due to human activities such as animal grazing, fuelwood extraction, timber
removal or other such activities, but which does not result in the conversion of forest to nonforest land (which would be classified as deforestation), and qualifies as forests remaining as
69

Appendix 1 Eligible AFOLU Project Categories

forests, such as set out under the IPCC 2003 Good Practice Guidance. The project area shall
meet an internationally accepted definition of forest, such as those based on UNFCCC hostcountry thresholds or FAO definitions, and shall qualify as forest for a minimum of 10 years
before the project start date. The definition of forest may include mature forests, secondary
forests, and degraded forests. Under the VCS Program, secondary forests are considered to be
forests that have been cleared and have recovered naturally and that are at least 10 years old
and meet the lower bound of the forest threshold parameters at the start of the project.
Forested wetlands, such as floodplain forests, peatland forests and mangrove forests, are also
eligible provided they meet the forest definition requirements mentioned above.
A1.6

Activities covered under the REDD project category are those that are designed to stop planned
(designated and sanctioned) deforestation or unplanned (unsanctioned) deforestation and/or
degradation. Avoided planned degradation is classified as IFM.

A1.7

Activities that stop unsanctioned deforestation and/or illegal degradation (such as removal of
fuelwood or timber extracted by non-concessionaires) on lands that are legally sanctioned for
timber production are eligible as REDD activities. However, activities that reduce or stop
logging only, followed by protection, on forest lands legally designated or sanctioned for forestry
activities are included within IFM. Projects that include both avoided unplanned deforestation
and/or degradation as well as stopping sanctioned logging activities, shall follow the REDD
guidelines for the unplanned deforestation and/or degradation and the IFM guidelines for the
sanctioned logging activities, and shall follow the requirements set out in Section 3.6.2.

A1.8

Eligible REDD activities include:
1) Avoiding Planned Deforestation (APD): This category includes activities that reduce net GHG
emissions by permanently stopping or reducing deforestation on forest lands that are
legally authorized and documented for conversion. Planned deforestation encompasses
activities where a forest system would have been cleared and replaced by a different forest
system with a lower carbon stock and where the recovery of timber was not the primary
objective of the initial forest clearance.
2) Avoiding Unplanned Deforestation and/or Degradation (AUDD): This category includes
activities that reduce net GHG emissions by stopping deforestation and/or degradation of
degraded to mature forests that would have occurred in any forest configuration.

Avoided Conversion of Grasslands and Shrublands (ACoGS)
A1.9

Eligible ACoGS activities are those that reduce net GHG emissions by reducing the conversion
of grassland and shrubland ecosystems to other land uses with lower carbon densities. Eligible
avoided conversion activities include avoiding, at a minimum, the removal/replacement of
vegetation and may also include avoiding soil disturbance.

70

Appendix 1 Eligible AFOLU Project Categories

A1.10 The project area shall be native grasslands (including savanna) and/or shrublands (including
chaparral). Non-forested wetlands, including peatlands, are not eligible under ACoGS and are
covered under other AFOLU project categories.
A1.11 Activities covered under the ACoGS project category are those that are designed to stop
planned (designated and sanctioned) conversion or unplanned (unsanctioned) conversion on
public or private lands. This category type only includes avoided conversion of non-forested
lands, noting that other management activities on non-forested land may qualify under ALM or
ARR project categories.
A1.12 Eligible ACoGS activities include:
1) Avoiding Planned Conversion (APC): This category includes activities that reduce net GHG
emissions by stopping conversion of grasslands or shrublands that are legally authorized
and documented for conversion.
2) Avoiding Unplanned Conversion (AUC): This category includes activities that reduce net
GHG emissions by stopping unplanned conversion of grasslands or shrublands.

Wetlands Restoration and Conservation (WRC)
A1.13 Eligible WRC activities are those that increase net GHG removals by restoring wetland
ecosystems or that reduce GHG emissions by rewetting or avoiding the degradation of
wetlands. The project area shall meet an internationally accepted definition of wetland, such as
from the IPCC, Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, those established by law or national policy, or
those with broad agreement in the peer-reviewed scientific literature for specific countries or
types of wetlands. Common wetland types include peatland, salt marsh, tidal freshwater marsh,
mangroves, wet floodplain forests, prairie potholes and seagrass meadows. WRC activities may
be combined with other AFOLU project categories, as further explained in Section A1.16.
A1.14 A peatland is an area with a layer of naturally accumulated organic material (peat) at the
surface (excluding the plant layer). Common peatland types include peat swamp forest, mire,
bog, fen, moor, muskeg and pocosin. Rewetting of drained peatland and the conservation of
undrained or partially drained peatland are sub-categories of restoring wetland ecosystems and
conservation of intact wetlands, respectively 21.
A1.15 Activities that generate net reductions of GHG emissions from wetlands are eligible as WRC
projects or combined category projects (such as REDD on peatland). Activities that actively
lower the water table depth in wetlands are not eligible. Eligible WRC activities include:
1) Restoring Wetland Ecosystems (RWE): This category includes activities that reduce GHG
emissions or increase carbon sequestration in a degraded wetland through restoration

21 These categories existed as rewetting drained peatlands (RDP) and conservation of undrained and partially drained

peatlands (CUPP) in the AFOLU Requirements v3.2.

71

Appendix 1 Eligible AFOLU Project Categories

activities. Such activities include enhancing, creating and/or managing hydrological
conditions, sediment supply, salinity characteristics, water quality and/or native plant
communities. For the purpose of these requirements, restoration activities are those that
result in the reestablishment of ecological processes, functions, and biotic and/or abiotic
linkages that lead to persistent, resilient systems integrated within the landscape.
2) Conservation of Intact Wetlands (CIW): This category includes activities that reduce GHG
emissions by avoiding degradation and/or the conversion of wetlands that are intact or
partially altered while still maintaining their natural functions, including hydrological
conditions, sediment supply, salinity characteristics, water quality and/or native plant
communities.
Wetland degradation or conversion can be planned (designated and sanctioned) or
unplanned (unsanctioned). Planned and unplanned degradation or conversion of wetlands
can therefore encompass a wide variety of activities such as those listed under REDD while
adding a wetland component. Activities covered under the CIW project category are those
that are designed to stop or reduce planned or unplanned degradation or conversion in the
project area to other land uses. The following CIW activities are eligible:
a) Avoiding Planned Wetland Degradation (APWD): This activity reduces GHG emissions by
avoiding degradation of wetlands, or further degradation in partially drained wetlands
that are legally authorized and documented for conversion.
b) Avoiding Unplanned Wetland Degradation (AUWD): This activity reduces GHG emissions
by avoiding unplanned degradation of wetlands, or by avoiding further degradation in
partially degraded wetlands.
Note – Activities where drainage is continued or maintained are not eligible. This includes, for
example, projects that require the maintenance of drainage channels to maintain the preproject drainage level on a partially drained peatland (e.g., where periodic deepening may be
needed to counteract peat subsidence). Projects that allow selective harvesting that results in
a lowering of the water table depth (e.g., by extracting timber using drainage canals) or affects
the ability of vegetation to act as a major hydrological regulation device (e.g., extracting trees
which support the peat body) are also not eligible. Project activities may include selective
harvesting where harvesting does not lower the water table, for example by extracting timber
using wooden rails instead of drainage canals.
Note – WRC activities that are unable to establish and demonstrate a significant difference in
the net GHG benefit between the baseline and project scenarios for at least 100 years are not
eligible, as set out in Section 3.2.14.
A1.16 Activities that generate net GHG emission reductions by combining other AFOLU project
activities with wetlands restoration or conservation activities are eligible as WRC combined
projects. RWE may be implemented without further conversion of land use, or it may be
combined with ARR, ALM, IFM, REDD or ACoGS activities, referred to as ARR+RWE, ALM+RWE,
IFM+RWE, REDD+RWE or ACoGS+RWE, respectively. CIW may be implemented on non-forest
72

land or combined with IFM, REDD or ACoGS activities, referred to as IFM+CIW, REDD+CIW or
ACoGS+CIW, respectively.
Table 4 illustrates the types of WRC activities that may be combined with other AFOLU project
categories. The table identifies the applicable AFOLU requirements that shall be followed for
combined category projects, based on the condition of the wetland in the baseline scenario, the
land use in the baseline scenario and the project activity.

v4.1

22 Apr 2021

Main updates (all effective on issue date, unless otherwise stated):
1) Required use of IPCC Fifth Assessment Report global warming potential values
(revised from Fourth Assessment Report values). See Section 3.14.4 for
details, including information on effective dates.
2) Clarified that VCUs used in the context of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement and
international Paris-related programs such as CORSIA must meet requirements
established under such agreements and programs, including those relating to
double counting and corresponding adjustments. Project proponent must use
VCU labels to demonstrate adherence to such requirements (Section 3.21.1).

4)

Further clarified eligibility conditions (effective dates) for projects registered
under another GHG program, with activities included within the scope of the
VCS Program (Section 2.1), seeking to transfer to the VCS Program. This
clarification builds upon Clarification 1 of Errata and Clarifications, VCS
Standard, v4.0, issued on 5 February 2021, by removing unintended
restrictions on projects registered with an approved GHG program. This also
clarifies that the conditions below apply to projects seeking to transfer from any
other GHG program, and not only to projects registered under an approved GHG
program. These eligibility conditions are clarified in the following paragraphs.
Projects registered under another GHG program, with activities that are included
within the scope of the VCS Program (see Section 2.1), shall only be eligible to
complete a gap validation and/or transfer to the VCS Program where the
following applies:26

For a project that does not include afforestation and/or reforestation activities:
i)

The project shall have an original project crediting period start date on or
after 1 January 2016 with another GHG program; or

ii)

Where the project has an original project crediting period start date from
1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015, the project shall have issued
credits during the period 1 January 2016 to 5 March 2021, or shall have
a status of “issuance requested” on the relevant GHG program registry
by 5 March 2021.

For a CDM Component Project Activity (CPA) that does not include afforestation
and/or reforestation activities:
i)

The CPA shall be part of a Program of Activities (PoA) with an original
program crediting period start date on or after 1 January 2016; or

ii)

Where the CPA is part of a Program of Activities (PoA) with an original
program crediting period start date from 1 January 2013 to 31
December 2015 and where the CPA has an original crediting period start
date from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015, the CPA shall have
issued credits during the period 1 January 2016 to 5 March 2021, or
shall have a status of “issuance requested” by 5 March 2021; or

26 A project is deemed to have met these timelines where Verra confirmed (in writing, to the project proponent or an

authorized representative) the project’s eligibility on or before 4 February 2021.

78

Appendix 3 Document History and Effective Dates
iii) Where the CPA is part of a PoA with an original program crediting period
start date from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015 and where the
CPA has an original crediting period start date on or after 1 January
2016, no prior credit issuance is required.
For a project with afforestation and/or reforestation activities, the project shall have
been registered under another GHG program on or after 1 January 2013.
For a CDM CPA with afforestation and/or reforestation activities, the CPA shall be part
of a PoA that was registered on or after 1 January 2013.

activities, only emission reductions with vintages beginning on or after 1
January 2016 are eligible for VCU issuance.

b)

For a project with afforestation and/or reforestation activities, only emission
reductions with vintages beginning on or after 1 January 2013 are eligible
for VCU issuance.

Further clarified eligibility conditions (effective dates) for projects registered
under another GHG program, with activities now excluded from the scope of the
VCS Program (Section 2.1), seeking to transfer to the VCS Program. This
clarification builds upon Clarification 2 of Errata and Clarifications, VCS
Standard, v4.0, issued on 5 February 2021, by clarifying that the conditions
below apply to projects seeking to transfer from any other GHG program, and
not only to projects registered under an approved GHG program. These
eligibility conditions are clarified in the following paragraph.
For project activities that were eligible under VCS Version 3, but are now excluded
from the scope of the VCS Program (Section 2.1) … Projects registered under
another GHG program shall only be eligible to complete a gap validation and/or
transfer to the VCS Program where the project has applied for registration with
the VCS Program on or before 9 March 2020, unless evidence of contracting for
a VCS gap validation prior to 9 March 2020 is provided. Where such evidence is
available, the project must also request pipeline listing with the VCS Program
on or before 5 March 2021 and complete gap validation on or before 31 May
2021. The project must also submit a request for registration with the VCS
Program on or before 30 June 2021.
